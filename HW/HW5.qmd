# 
If the matrices of the previous exercise are transition matrices, for which do all $\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$ remain bounded as $k \rightarrow \infty$ ? Are any of these matrices stable?

#
The three-stage insect model of Example 2.21 yields a transition matrix

$$
A=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0.2 & 0 & 0.25 \\
0.6 & 0.3 & 0 \\
0 & 0.6 & 0.8
\end{array}\right]
$$

Use a technology tool to calculate the eigenvalues of this matrix. Deduce that $A$ is diagonalizable and determine the approximate growth rate from one state to the next (after much time has passed), given a random initial vector.

#

The financial model of Example 2.27 gives rise to a discrete dynamical system $x^{(k+1)}=A x^{(k)}$, where the transition matrix is

$$
A=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 0.06 & 0.12 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Use a technology tool to calculate the eigenvalues of this matrix. Deduce that $A$ is diagonalizable and determine the approximate growth rate from one state to the next, given a random initial vector. 


Find a starting vector $x^{(0)}$ such that growth rate for the first few iterations is quite different from this approximate growth rate, and demonstrate this using a technology tool.

(If you do this using Sympy, and you set up the matrix A using rational numbers, you can get exact results and find a starting vector never reach the approximate growth rage. You can see how this result changes if you use floating point numbers at some point in the calculation, e.g. `x = N(x)`.)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
from sympy import Matrix, Rational

# Set up the matrix A in symbolic form
A = Matrix([[1, Rational(6, 100), Rational(12, 100)], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])
```

Doing it with numpy:
```{python}
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 0.06, 0.12], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])
# find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)
print(eigenvalues)
print(eigenvectors)
```


```{python}
x = eigenvectors[2]
# pick a random initial vector
x = np.random.rand(3)
for i in range(10):
    xnew = A @ x
    print(xnew[0] / x[0])
    x = xnew
```

Doing it with sympy:

```{python}
from sympy import Matrix, symbols, randprime, Rational,N
from sympy.abc import x


A = Matrix([[1, Rational(6, 100), Rational(12, 100)], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])


# find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues = A.eigenvals()
eigenvectors = A.eigenvects()

print("Eigenvalues:")
for value in eigenvalues:
    print(value)

print("\nEigenvectors:")
for vector in eigenvectors:
    print(vector)

# pick a random initial vector
#x = Matrix([randprime(1, 10) for _ in range(3)])

# use the third eigenvector as the initial
x = eigenvectors[0][2][0]

for i in range(100):
    #xnew = N(A * x)
    xnew= A * x
    growth_rate = N(xnew[0] / x[0])
    print(f"Growth rate at iteration {i}: {growth_rate}")
    x = xnew

Do this by hand.

A species of bird can be divided into three age groups: age less than 2 years for group 1, age between 2 and 4 years for group 2, and age between 4 and 6 years for the third group. Assume that these birds have at most a 6-year life span. It is estimated that the survival rates for birds in groups 1 and 2 are $50 \%$ and 75\%, respectively. Also, birds in groups 1, 2, and 3 produce 0,1 , and 3 offspring on average in any biennium (period of 2 years). 

(a) Model this bird population as a discrete dynamical system and analyze the long-term change in the population -- give a percentage by which the population of group 1 changes from year to year.

(b) Now suppose that the survival rates for group 1 and 2 are not known (so are no longer assumed to be 50\% and 75\%), but are assumed to be equal to one another. What value for this survival rate would make the population stable in the long run?
