The simple workaround is to always permute the rows of the matrix such that the largest nonzero entry in a column is chosen as the pivot entry. This ensures that a nearly zero is never chosen. Complete pivoting goes even further by using row and column permutations to select the largest entry in the entire matrix as the pivot entry.\" from [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1535376/complete-pivoting-vs-partial-pivoting-in-gauss-elimination)\n",
