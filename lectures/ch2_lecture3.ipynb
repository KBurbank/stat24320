When you see a visual representation of this function (a graph of it) what you are really seeing is a discrete sampling of values of this continuous points at some resolution - a dot-to-dot so to speak.\n",

        "Example 2.71. Consider the function $f(t)=\\cos (\\pi t),-1 \\leq t \\leq 1$ which defines the exact signal that we want to sample. Suppose that what we actually sample is this signal plus noise, namely the function $g(t)=\\cos (\\pi t)+$ $\\frac{1}{5} \\sin (24 \\pi t)+\\frac{1}{4} \\cos (30 \\pi t)$. Note that the signal $f(t)$ is the low frequency portion of $g(t)$ and the noise is the high frequency portion of $g(t)$. Suppose further that sampling is at the equally spaced points $t_{k}=-1+\\frac{2}{64} k, k=0,1, \\ldots, 64$, yielding data points $x_{k}=g\\left(t_{k}\\right)$. We apply the following length two filter to the data:\n",

We shall interpret the number $y_{k}$ as the filtered value of the noisy $x_{k}=g\\left(t_{k}\\right), k=2,3, \\ldots 64$ and therefore the approximation to $f\\left(t_{k}\\right)$ that results from this filtering. A graph of the exact data, noisy data and filtered data is given in Figure 2.10. Although it is somewhat crude (reliance on earlier values causes a slight forward shift in the filtered values), it appears to do a decent job of filtering out the noise in the sampled signal $g(t)$.\n",
