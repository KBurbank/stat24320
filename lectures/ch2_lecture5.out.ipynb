        "Another type of matrix that occurs frequently enough to be discussed is a block matrix. Actually, we already used the idea of blocks when we described the augmented matrix of the system $A \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ as the matrix $\\tilde{A}=[A \\mid \\mathbf{b}]$. The blocks of $\\tilde{A}$ in partitioned form $[A, \\mathbf{b}]$ are $A$ and $\\mathbf{b}$. There is no reason we couldn't partition by inserting more vertical lines or horizontal lines as well, and this partitioning leads to the blocks. The main point to bear in mind when using the block notation is that the blocks must be correctly Block Notation sized so that the resulting matrix makes sense. One virtue of the block form that results from partitioning is that for purposes of matrix addition or multiplication, we can treat the blocks rather like scalars, provided the addition or multiplication that results makes sense. We will use this idea from time to time without fanfare. One could go through a formal description of partitioning and proofs; we won't. Rather, we'll show how this idea can be used by example.\n",

The idea is simple: Interchange rows and columns.
