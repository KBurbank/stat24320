The rank of the augmented matrix is 2, but the system is inconsistent.\nWe know that \\(b\\) must not be a linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\) for the system to be inconsistent; however, there is no requirement that the columns of \\(A\\) be linearly independent. Therefore the rank of the augmented matrix could be less than the number of unknowns.\n\nTrue, a homogeneous system must have the trivial solution.\nFalse, it could be inconsistent (and therefore have zero solutions).\nFalse. Here is a counterexample. The matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) can be reduced to either \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) or \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\). (Only the latter is in reduced row echelon form, which must be unique.)\nFalse, a counterexample is \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right] x=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\)."

Express this operator and the operator that results from reversing the order of the scaling and rotation as matrix operators.\n\nExercise 2.3.5 The scaling operator is given by the matrix\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nTo create a counterclockwise rotation by \\(\\theta\\) radians, we use the matrix\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nHere, we want to rotate by \\(\\pi / 6\\) radians, so we have\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{6} & -\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\\\\n\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} & \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThe operator for the scaling followed by the rotation is the product of these two matrices:\n\\[T_{A}, A=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\sqrt{3} & -2 \\\\\n1 & 2 \\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThe operator for the rotation followed by the scaling is the product of the matrices in reverse order:\n\\[T_{B}, B=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\sqrt{3} & -1 \\\\\n2 & 2 \\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\n\n6 \nFind a scaling operator \\(S\\) and shearing operator \\(H\\) such that the concatenation \\(S \\circ H\\) maps the points \\((1,0)\\) to \\((2,0)\\) and \\((0,1)\\) to \\((4,3)\\).\n\nExercise 2.3.7\nWe know that the shearing operator must add a multiple of the \\(x_2\\) component to the \\(x_1\\) component. For now, we can write this as\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\alpha \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThen we can apply the shearing operator to our two points to get\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\alpha \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\alpha \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\alpha \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWe know our scaling operator will be of the form\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\ns & 0 \\\\\n0 & t\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nApplying this to our two points, we get\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\ns & 0 \\\\\n0 & t\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\ns \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\ns & 0 \\\\\n0 & t\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\alpha \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\ns \\alpha \\\\\nt\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWe can now set up the equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ns &=2 , 0=0\\\\\n\\alpha s &=4,\nt =3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is clear that the solutions to these equations are \\(s=2, t=3, \\alpha=2\\). Thus, our scaling operator is\n\\[\nS=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nand our shearing operator is\n\\[\nH=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nChecking:\n\nS = Matrix([[2, 0], [0, 3]])\nH = Matrix([[1, 2], [0, 1]])\nS*H*Matrix([1,0]), S*H*Matrix([0,1])\n\n(Matrix([\n [2],\n [0]]),\n Matrix([\n [4],\n [3]]))\n\n\n\n\n\n7 \nGiven transition matrices for discrete dynamical systems\n\n\\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}.1 & .3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & .4 & 1 \\\\ .9 & .3 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\) (b) \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\) (c) \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}.5 & .3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & .4 & 0 \\\\ .5 & .3 & 1\\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\) (d) \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}0 & 0 & 0.9 \\\\ 0.5 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5 & 0.1\\end{array}\\right]\\) and initial state vector \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}=\\frac{1}{2}(1,1,0)\\), calculate the first and second state vector for each system and determine whether it is a Markov chain.\n\n\nExercise 2.3.11\nWe know going in that (d) is not a stochastic matrix, because the neither the first or second column sums to 1. The others are stochastic.\nFirst and second states are (a) \\((0.2,0.2,0.6)\\), \\((0.08,0.68,0.24)\\) (b) \\(\\frac{1}{2}(0,1,1), \\frac{1}{2}(1,1,0)\\) (c) \\((0.4,0.3,0.4),(0.26,0.08,0.66)\\) (d) \\((0,0.25,0.25),(0.225,0,0.15)\\)\nAs expected, the states sum to 1 for a-c, but not for d. Therefore a-c are Markov chains.\n\n\n\n8 \nFor each of the dynamical systems of the previous exercise, determine by calculation whether the system tends to a limiting steady-state vector. If so, what is it?\n\nExercise 2.3.12\nWe can do this in Python by multiplying the initial state vector by each matrix a large number of times and seeing if the result converges.\n\nfrom sympy import

(a) The first column says that \\(50 \\%\\) of the immature become mature and \\(50 \\%\\) of the immature remain immature in one time period. The second column says that none of the mature survive, but each mature individual produces one immature in one time period. (b) The total populations after \\(0,3,6,9,18\\) time periods is a constant 130 , and populations tend to approximately \\((86.667,43.333)\\).\n\n\n\n10 \nA digraph \\(G\\) has vertex set \\(V=\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\) and edge set \\(E=\\) \\(\\{(2,1),(1,5),(2,5),(5,4),(4,2),(4,3),(3,2)\\}\\). Sketch a picture of the graph \\(G\\) and find its adjacency matrix. Use this to find the power of each vertex of the graph and determine whether this graph is dominance-directed.\n\nExercise 2.3.15\nPowers of vertices \\(1-5\\) are \\(2,4,3,5,3\\), respectively. Graph is dominance directed (there are no bi-directional edges between any pairs of vertices), adjacency matrix is \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\).
