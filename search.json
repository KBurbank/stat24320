Hint: Experiment with a \\(2 \\times 2\\) or \\(3 \\times 3\\) system.\n\n\n(Meyer 1.2.13) a. This has the effect of interchanging the order of the unknowns \\(-x_{j}\\) and \\(x_{k}\\) are p b. The solution to the new system is the same as the solution to the old system except that the solution for the \\(j^{\\text {th }}\\) unknown of the new system is \\(\\hat{x}_{j}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha} x_{j}\\). This has the effect of “changing the units” of the \\(j^{\\text {th }}\\) unknown. c. The solution to the new system is the same as the solution for the old system except that the solution for the \\(k^{t h}\\) unknown in the new system is \\(\\hat{x}_{k}=x_{k}-\\alpha x_{j}\\).\n\n\n\n4 \nUse the Gauss-Jordan method to solve the following three systems at the same time.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rr|l|l}\n2 x_{1}-x_{2} & =1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-x_{1}+2 x_{2}-x_{3}&=0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-x_{2}+x_{3}&=0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n(Meyer 1.3.3) \\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{lll}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\n5 \nConsider the following system:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n10^{-3} x-y & =1, \\\\\nx+y & =0 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nUse 3-digit arithmetic with no pivoting to solve this system.\nFind a system that is exactly satisfied by your solution from part (a), and note how close this system is to the original system.\nNow use partial pivoting and 3-digit arithmetic to solve the original system.\nFind a system that is exactly satisfied by your solution from part (c), and note how close this system is to the original system.\nUse exact arithmetic to obtain the solution to the original system, and compare the exact solution with the results of parts (a) and (c).\nRound the exact solution to three significant digits, and compare the result with those of parts (a) and (c).\n\n\n(Meyer 1.5.1) (a)\n\\(\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}0.001 & -1 & 1\\\\1 & 1 & 0\\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\) \\(\\overrightarrow{E_{2,1}(1000)}\\) \\(\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}0.001 & -1.0 & 1.0\\\\0 & 1.0 \\cdot 10^{3} & -1.0 \\cdot 10^{3}\\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\) \\(\\overrightarrow{E_{1}(1000)}\\) \\(\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}1.00 & -1.00 \\cdot 10^{3} & 1.00 \\cdot 10^{3}\\\\0 & 1.00 \\cdot 10^{3} & -1.00 \\cdot 10^{3}\\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\)\nThe solution is \\((0,-1)\\).\n\nOne example of a system whose exact solution is \\(0,-1\\) would be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n2x-y & =1, \\\\\nx+y & =-1 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is not close at all to the original system!\n\n\n\n\\(\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}0.001 & -1 & 1\\\\1 & 1 & 0\\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\) \\(\\overrightarrow{E_{2,1}}\\) \\(\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}1.0 & 1.0 & 0\\\\0.001 & -1.0 & 1.0\\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\) \\(\\overrightarrow{E_{2,1}(1/1000)}\\) \\(\\left[\\begin{smallmatrix}1.00 & 1.00 & 0\\\\-7.25 \\cdot 10^{-8} & -1.00 & 1.00\\end{smallmatrix}\\right]\\)\nSolution is \\((1,-1)\\).\n\nOne example of a system whose exact solution is \\(1,-1\\) would be \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 x-y & =1, \\\\\nx+y & =0 .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThis is very close to the original system!\n\n\\(\\left(\\frac{1}{1.001}, \\frac{-1}{1.001}\\right)\\)\n\nThis is close to our solution in (c).\n\n\n\n6 \nConsider the following well-scaled matrix:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{W}_{n}=\\left(\\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}\n1 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 1 & \\ddots & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n-1 & -1 & -1 & \\ddots & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & -1 & \\cdots & -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & -1 & \\cdots & -1 & -1 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\n\nReduce \\(\\mathbf{W}_{n}\\) to an upper-triangular form using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, and determine the element of maximal magnitude that emerges during the elimination procedure.\n\n\n(Meyer 1.5.7) \\(2^{n-1}\\)\n\n\n\n7 \nAnswer True/False and explain your answers: 1. If a linear system is inconsistent, then the rank of the augmented matrix exceeds the number of unknowns. 2. Any homogeneous linear system is consistent. 3. A system of 3 linear equations in 4 unknowns has infinitely many solutions. 4. Every matrix can be reduced to only one matrix in row echelon form. 5. Any homogeneous linear system with more equations than unknowns has a nontrivial solution.\n\n(Shores 1.4.19)\n\nFalse. One very simple counterexample: \\(0 x=1\\).\n\nAnother: \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\). The rank of the augmented matrix is 2, but the system is inconsistent.\nWe know that \\(b\\) must not be a linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\) for the system to be inconsistent; however, there is no requirement that the columns of \\(A\\) be linearly independent. Therefore the rank of the augmented matrix could be less than the number of unknowns.\n\nTrue, a homogeneous system must have the trivial solution.\nFalse, it could be inconsistent (and therefore have zero solutions).\nFalse. Here is a counterexample. The matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) can be reduced to either \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) or \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\). (Only the latter is in reduced row echelon form, which must be unique.)\nFalse, a counterexample is \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right] x=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\)."
