Assume that a minute is not enough time for an insect to visit more than one chamber and that at the end of a minute \\(40 \\%\\) of the insects in each chamber have not left the chamber they occupied at the beginning of the minute.

You know that performing row operations on \\([\\mathbf{A} \\mid \\mathbf{b}]\\) does not change the solution of the system. However, no mention of column operations was ever made because column operations can alter the solution.\n\nDescribe the effect on the solution of a linear system when columns \\(\\mathbf{A}_{* j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}_{* k}\\) are interchanged.\nDescribe the effect when column \\(\\mathbf{A}_{* j}\\) is replaced by \\(\\alpha \\mathbf{A}_{* j}\\) for \\(\\alpha \\neq 0\\).\nDescribe the effect when \\(\\mathbf{A}_{* j}\\) is replaced by \\(\\mathbf{A}_{* j}+\\alpha \\mathbf{A}_{* k}\\).

If a linear system is inconsistent, then the rank of the augmented matrix exceeds the number of unknowns. 2. Any homogeneous linear system is consistent. 3. A system of 3 linear equations in 4 unknowns has infinitely many solutions. 4. Every matrix can be reduced to only one matrix in row echelon form. 5. Any homogeneous linear system with more equations than unknowns has a nontrivial solution.\n\n(Shores 1.4.19)\n\nFalse. One very simple counterexample: \\(0 x=1\\).\n\nAnother: \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]\\). The rank of the augmented matrix is 2, but the system is inconsistent.\nWe know that \\(b\\) must not be a linear combination of the columns of \\(A\\) for the system to be inconsistent; however, there is no requirement that the columns of \\(A\\) be linearly independent. Therefore the rank of the augmented matrix could be less than the number of unknowns.\n\nTrue, a homogeneous system must have the trivial solution.\nFalse, it could be inconsistent (and therefore have zero solutions).\nFalse. Here is a counterexample. The matrix \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) can be reduced to either \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) or \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\). (Only the latter is in reduced row echelon form, which must be unique.)\nFalse, a counterexample is \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right] x=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\\)."
