The position of each point is measured by setting the leftmost point at 0.0 meters and rightmost at 1.0 meters. Initially, a small amount of a certain gas is inserted in the central insertion point. Subsequently, measurements of the concentration of the gas at each sampling/insertion point are taken at later times in seconds. The results of these measurements, which you may assume are accurate to about 2-3 digits, are specified in Table 1.1. Based on this information, your task is to determine the best estimate you can find for the true value of the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\) of this gas in a motionless air medium. Use this estimate and a marching method to calculate values of the material density function on the interval \\([0,1]\\) at times \\(t=210\\) and \\(t=300\\) and at the given spatial nodes.\n\nConcentration data measurements of a gaseous material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSec \\(\\backslash\\) Meter\n0\n\\(1 / 6\\)\n\\(1 / 3\\)\n\\(1 / 2\\)\n\\(2 / 3\\)\n\\(5 / 6\\)\n1\n\n\n\n\n\\(t=240\\)\n0.0\n0.032\n1.23\n3.69\n1.23\n0.032\n0.0\n\n\n\\(t=270\\)\n0.0\n0.051\n1.21\n3.48\n1.21\n0.051\n0.0\n\n\n\nProcedure: You should use equation (1.10) or some variant to move backward and forward in time. These will result in linear systems, which ALAMA calculator or another technology tool can solve. One way to proceed is simply to use trial and error until you think you’ve hit on a reasonable value of \\(D\\), that is, the one that gives the best approximation to \\(t=180\\) from the \\(t=360\\) values.

If you’re interested in doing this project, you can look at the second part of the Chapter 2 Lecture 4 slides.\n(Shores p. 177) Write a program module that implements Theorem 2.14 using partial pivoting and implicit row exchanges. This means that space is allocated for the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A=[a[i, j]]\\) and an array of row indices, say indx \\([i]\\). Initially, indx should consist of the integers \\(1,2, \\ldots, n\\). Whenever two rows need to be exchanged, say the first and third, then the indices indx[1] and indx[3] are exchanged. References to array elements throughout the Gaussian elimination process should be indirect: Refer to the \\((1,4)\\) th entry of \\(A\\) as the element \\(a[\\operatorname{indx}[1], 4]\\). This method of reference has the same effect as physically exchanging rows, but without the work. It also has the appealing feature that we can design the algorithm as though no row exchanges have taken place provided we replace the direct reference \\(a[i, j]\\) by the indirect reference \\(a[\\operatorname{indx}[i], j]\\). The module should return the lower/upper matrix in the format of Example 2.70 as well as the permuted array indx \\([i]\\). Effectively, this index array tells the user what the permutation matrix \\(P\\) is.\nUse this module to implement an LU system solver module that uses the \\(\\mathrm{LU}\\) factorization to solve a general linear system. Also write a module that finds the inverse of an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) by first using the LU factorization module, then making repeated use of the LU system solver to solve \\(A \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}=\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\) th column of the identity. Then we will have\n\\[\nA^{-1}=\\left[\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \\mathbf{x}^{(2)}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}^{(n)}\\right]\n\\]\nBe sure to document and test your code and report on the results.\nMarkov Chains\n(Shores p. 177)\nRefer to Example 2.19 and Section 2.3 for background. Three automobile insurance firms compete for a fixed market of customers. Annual premiums are sold to these customers. Label the companies A, B, and C. You work for Company A, and your team of market analysts has done a survey that draws the following conclusions: In each of the past three years, the number of A customers switching to B is \\(20 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) is \\(30 \\%\\). The number of \\(\\mathrm{B}\\) customers switching to \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) is \\(20 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) is \\(20 \\%\\). The number of \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) customers switching to \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) is \\(30 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{B}\\) is \\(10 \\%\\). Those who do not switch continue to use their current company’s insurance for the next year. Model this market as a Markov chain. Display the transition matrix for the model. Illustrate the workings of the model by showing what it would predict as the market shares three years from now if currently \\(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\), and \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) owned equal shares of the market.\nThe next part of your problem is as follows: Your team has tested two advertising campaigns in some smaller test markets and are confident that the first campaign will convince \\(20 \\%\\) of the B customers who would otherwise stay with B in a given year to switch to A. The second advertising campaign would convince \\(20 \\%\\) of the \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) customers who would otherwise stay with C in a given year to switch to A. Both campaigns have about equal costs and would not change other customers’ habits. Make a recommendation, based on your experiments with various possible initial state vectors for the market. Will these campaigns actually improve your company’s market share? If so, which one do you recommend? Write up your recommendation in the form of a report, with supporting evidence. It’s a good idea to hedge on your bets a little by pointing out limitations to your model and claims, so devote a few sentences to those points.\nIt would be a plus to carry the analysis further (your manager might appreciate that). For instance, you could turn the additional market share from, say B customers, into a variable and plot the long-term gain for your company against this variable. A manager could use this data to decide whether it was worthwhile to attempt gaining more customers from B.\nSports Ranking\n(Shores p. 180)\nRefer to Example 2.24 and Section 2.3 for background. As a sports analyst you are given the following data about a league of seven teams numbered 1-7, where the pair \\((j, k)\\) represents a game in which team \\(j\\) defeated team \\(k\\) :\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE= & \\{(1,2),(7,3),(2,4),(4,5),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1),(3,1),(7,2),(2,6), \\\\\n& (3,4),(7,4),(5,7),(6,4),(3,5),(5,6),(7,1),(5,2),(7,6),(1,4),(6,3)\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBased on these data you are to rank the teams. To this end, begin with the simplest method, ranking by win/loss record. Next, treat the data as defining a digraph. Begin this analysis by constructing the adjacency matrix of this digraph and drawing a picture of the digraph either by hand or using some software. Then rank the teams by using the following methods: First use the method of Example 2.26 to find a power ranking of each team. Then use the reverse PageRank idea of Example 2.47 to rank the the teams.\nNext, suppose you are given additional information, namely, the game margins (winning score minus losing score) for each game. Following is a list of these margins matching the order of matches in the definition of \\(E\\) :\n\\[\nM=\\{4,8,7,3,7,7,23,15,6,18,13,14,7,13,7,18,45,10,19,14,13\\}\n\\]\nIn order to utilize these data examine your picture of the digraph and label each edge with the margin that matches it in \\(M\\). You are now dealing with a weighted graph and one can construct a different sort of “adjacency matrix” by entering this margin in the \\((i, j)\\) th entry according as team \\(i\\) defeated team \\(j\\) by that margin. Use this approach to calculate “power ranking”.\nIsoRank\nRead the discussion of IsoRank on pages 172-176.\nThe notion of embedding one graph into another is a useful idea for some scientific studies. In this report you will test the basic idea of network embedding by using the variant IsoRank of the PageRank technique on three relatively simple examples. This project requires a technology tool for these calculations and the resulting output should be interpreted as in the discussion of the IsoRank technique following Example 2.73 of Section 2.8.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14\n\n\nBy an isomorphism of graphs we mean a one-to-one edge preserving map of vertices from one graph onto another. One can think of an isomorphism as simply a relabeling of the vertices of a graph. The first test is to provide an example of how well IsoRank can recognize isomorphisms. Consider the graph of Figure 2.13. Let \\(G_{1}\\) be the graph with vertices \\(1,2,3,4,5\\) in that order and \\(G_{2}\\) the same graph with vertices \\(A, B, C, D, E\\) in that order. Apply IsoRank to these two graphs and discuss the validity of your results.\nThe next embedding test is to remove the edge connecting vertices \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) in Figure 2.12 and use IsoRank with teleportation vector \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{e} / 15\\) and teleportation parameter \\(\\alpha=0.85\\) to find the best matchings of the graph \\(G_{1}\\) with the resulting graph \\(G_{2}\\). List all possible mappings that are calculated.\nThe last embedding test is to use IsoRank with teleportation vector \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\) \\(\\mathrm{e} / 15\\) and teleportation parameter \\(\\alpha=0.85\\), along with correction vector \\(\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{e} / 5\\) for \\(G_{2}\\), to find the best matchings of the digraph \\(G_{1}\\) with the digraph \\(G_{2}\\) in Figure 2.14.

The position of each point is measured by setting the leftmost point at 0.0 meters and rightmost at 1.0 meters. Initially, a small amount of a certain gas is inserted in the central insertion point.

Based on this information, your task is to determine the best estimate you can find for the true value of the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\) of this gas in a motionless air medium.

Here is the exact form:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial a(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D_{a}\\frac{\\partial^{2} a(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}}\\]\n\nWalk through why we have a first derivative for time, and a second derivative for space. It’s because if the concentration is increasing steadily in space at a given position, the same amount will enter (from the left) and leave (from the right). We only end up with a changing concentration if the rate of entry and exit are different.\n\n\nWe approximated this using the finite-difference method:\nTime derivative (which we had set to zero):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial a(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{1}{dt}(a_{x,t+1} - a_{x,t})\n\\]\nSpacial part of the derivative (which is usually know as the Laplacian):\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} a(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{dx^{2}}(a_{x+1,t} + a_{x-1,t} - 2a_{x,t})\n\\]\n\n\nThis gives us the finite-difference equation:\n\\[\na_{x,t+1} = a_{x,t} + dt\\left(  \\frac{D_{a}}{dx^{2}}(a_{x+1,t} + a_{x-1,t} - 2a_{x,t})  \\right)\n\\]\n\n\nAdapted from this blog post."

    "text": "Partial pivoting\nWe can improve performance of G-J by introducing a new step into the algorithm:\n\nFind the entry in the left column with the largest absolute value. This entry is called the pivot. Perform row interchange (if necessary), so that the pivot is in the first row.\nUse a row operation to get a 1 as the entry in the first row and first column.\nUse row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column one.\nInterchange rows if necessary to obtain a nonzero number with the largest absolute value in the second row, second column. Use a row operation to make this entry 1. Use row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column two.\nRepeat step 4 for row 3, column 3. Continue moving along the main diagonal until you reach the last row, or until the number is zero.\n\n\nFull pivoting is where we also move the columns around to get the largest element to the front.\n” A square matrix 𝐴 has an 𝐿𝑈 factorization (without pivoting) if, and only if, no zero is encountered in the pivot position when computing an 𝐿𝑈 factorization of 𝐴. However, when does computations using floating point numbers a pivot that is nearly zero can lead to dramatic rounding errors. The simple workaround is to always permute the rows of the matrix such that the largest nonzero entry in a column is chosen as the pivot entry. This ensures that a nearly zero is never chosen. Complete pivoting goes even further by using row and column permutations to select the largest entry in the entire matrix as the pivot entry.” from here\nIt’s very rare to find yourself in a situation where you need complete pivoting, and sometimes it can be quite computationally expensive."

We can’t just use the stationary distribution of the Markov chain anymore.\nWe could try to calculate the distribution of users, but that’s hard.\nInstead, we can use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to sample from the distribution of users. We can then use these samples to estimate the average revenue per page.\nTo do Gibbs sampling, we will sample from the distribution of each variable given the other variables. This is easier than sampling from the joint distribution of all the variables.\nSo for instance, we might suppose that a user is male, 25 years old, and on the webpage for the Chicago Cubs. We can specify a distribution of locations for the user’s location given this information. Sample from that distribution.\nThen, we can say ok, we’ve got a user who is 25 years old, on the webpage for the Cubs, and in Chicago.

The basic idea of MCMC is that you can sample from a distribution by starting at some point and then moving around in a way that the distribution of your samples will eventually match the distribution you’re interested in.\nFor Gibbs sampling, you start with a random sample, and then you update each variable in turn, given the other variables. This may be much easier to compute than needing to know the full transition matrix for every possible pair of states. (We are in high dimensions here, because every node in our network is a variable.)\nIn the case of the RBM, you update each hidden node given the visible nodes, and then you update each visible node given the hidden nodes. You keep doing this for a while, and then you have a sample from the distribution you’re interested in.\nNow you compare this sample to your data, and you adjust the weights in your network to make the sample look more like the data."

If you do this, you’ll also be able to look at the 10 year matrices and reach a conclusion about which campaign is best for the long term, even without having to do the simulation.\nThere is an issue with the random vectors here – the first element of the vector ends up being twice as large as the other two, on average.\n\nx=[]\nfor i in range(2000):\n    x.append(generate_input_vector())\nimport pylab as plt\n\n\nimport numpy as np\ny=np.array(x)\ny.shape\nnp.mean(y, axis=0)\n\narray([[0.499943500000000],\n       [0.251202500000000],\n       [0.248854000000000]], dtype=object)\n\n\n\nI would reccomended going with the second campaign. I ran the following test to come to this conclusion:\nFirst, I randomly generated 2000 inital vectors. I also set up a function that runs, for 10 iterations (i.e. 10 year forcast), the markov chains representing the cases of 1) no ad campaigns 2) the first ad campaign and 3) the third ad campaign. I ran each randomly generated inital vector each markov chain and then counted for which case ended with the highest market share.\nFor all 2,000 inital vectors, the second ad campaign ended with the highest market share. Therefore, I strongly reccomended moving forward with the second ad campaign when considering long-term interests.\nSome limitations of this study may be that it only looks at the long term since it uses a a ten year model. Therefore, if the company is looking for short term gains (next quarter, the next year, etc), then these results may not be helpful and a new study should be conducted. In addition, this model assumes that there is no counter-ad campaign from another company that may change the transition matrix. In other words, this study does not anticipate other changing factors in the market that may change the transition matrix and thus the results.\n\nI liked that you chose to use many random vectors for evaluating the different campaigns (although see the note about the random vectors above).\nI would like to see a bit more thinking about why you got the results that you did. Is there something about the transition matrices that tells you why the second campaign is the best?\nGrade: S (satisfactory)"

Then, I’d like a discussion of why the different rankings give different results, and which one you think is the most accurate.\nAlso: there are a lot of places where you are doing things manually (like entering the identity matrix by hand) or using loops to do matrix computations. You’d be better off using numpy or sympy functions to do these things, as they are much faster and less error-prone (and easier to write, too!)\nGrade: R"

But I’d like to see a better job testing the outputs. When you run the problems from HW3, how am I supposed to know if these outputs are what they should be? You could either write something like “this should be upper triangular, and it is, and this should be …”, and/or you could do some kind of test (I bet either numpy or sympy has a function to test whether a matrix is upper triangular.)\nIn general, I’m trying to read your code to figure out what you were doing, but I’d prefer to have you tell me what you’re doing and why you’re doing it in prose as well as in the code.\nFor the testing, I’m curious about how this algorithm compares to some built-in solvers. Could you run it many times and compare e.g. the speed to one of the built-in systems? (I’m sure yours will be slower, that’s find, just curious about the difference!)\nGrade: R"

Projects are slightly longer and more open-ended than homework problems. Projects will be graded on an ESMU scale. (This stands for Excellent, Meets Expectations, Revision necessary, and Ungradeable.)\nFor each of the first two project packs, you’ll have the chance to revise and resubmit up to two projects, so long as they were initially graded with an M or R. For the third project pack, you won’t be able to revise and resubmit projects (because this will be due at the end of the quarter).\n\n\nFinal exam\nThere will be a final exam during exam week, in two parts. The first part will be similar to the problems in the problem sets. The second part will be a critical analysis of some applications. You’ll have to suggest directions that you might take in an analysis and look for potential weaknesses in a provided analysis. However, if you’ve gotten at least two Es on your project packs, you won’t have to take the final exam.\nWe will not have a midterm exam."

There are 90 points possible in the project packs, 10 for each project that you complete.\nYou’ll get 10 points for an E or M grade, and 5 points for an R grade. You’ll get 0 points for a U grade. If you revise and resubmit, you’ll get the full points for the grade you receive on the resubmission. If you have at least two E’s from the first two project packs, you may choose to skip the second part of the final exam; in this case, the project packs will be worth 65% of the final grade.\nThe grading for the final project pack will be done differently. You’ll still get 10 points for an E or an M. However, if you get an R on one project and an E on another, the E can be used to bring the R up to an M. So if your grades are E, R, M, this would be changed to M, M, M, for full credit. If your grades are M, R, R, you’d get 20/30 points for this project pack. If your grades are E, R, R, this would be changed to M, M, R, and you’d get 25/30 points. If you get an E on one project and a U on another, the E can be used to bring the U up to an R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading examples\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at two example students.\nStudent A has the following grades going into the final exam: Problem sets: 90% Project Pack 1: E, S, S (after revision) -&gt; 30/30 Project Pack 2: E, E, S (after revision) -&gt; 30/30\nThe student chooses to skip the second part of the final exam.\nHer grade on the first part of the final exam is 80%. Her grades for the third Project Pack are R, E, R. -&gt; 25/30.\nWhen combined, this student’s project pack grades are 85/90, or 94.4%.\nHer final course grade is 94.40.65+90.20+80*.15 = 91.36%.\nStudent B has the following grades going into the final exam: Problem sets: 80% Project Pack 1: E, S, R (after revision) -&gt; 25/30 Project Pack 2: S, R, R (after revision) -&gt; 20/30\nThis student does not have the option to skip the second part of the final exam.\nHer grade on the first part of the final exam is 87%. Her grade on the second part of the final exam is 90%. Her grade on the third project pack is E, R, R, which becomes S, S, R, for 25/30.\nWhen combined, this student’s project pack grades are 70/90, or 77.8%.\nHer final course grade is 77.80.50+80.20+87.15+90.15 = 81.45%."

    "text": "Reaction Diffusion Equations\nReaction-Diffusion equations are a class of partial differential equations whose dynamics are governed by two terms: a diffusion part and a reaction part. We will be looking at the two component case, which takes the form\n\\(\\frac{\\partial a(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D_{a}\\frac{\\partial^{2} a(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}} + R_{a}(a(x,t),b(x,t))\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\partial b(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D_{b}\\frac{\\partial^{2} b(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}} + R_{b}(a(x,t),b(x,t))\\)\nWhere the \\(a(x,t)\\) and \\(b(x,t)\\) describe the concentration of chemicals \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) at position \\(x\\) and time \\(t\\). The functions \\(R_{a}\\) and \\(R_{b}\\) determine how the concentrations change due to interspecies reactions and \\(D_{a}\\) and \\(D_{b}\\) are the diffusion coefficients.\n\nDiffusion\nThe diffusion part of the equations causes areas of high concentration to spread out to areas of low concentration, while conserving the total amount of the chemical. To get a feel for what’s happening, let’s focus the equation\n$ = D_{a} $\nIf this looks familiar, it is because it appears in a number of different areas of science and maths. A few are: the diffusion equation, the heat equation and Brownian motion.\nIt has an analytic solution, which for initial Gaussian distribution is\n$ a(x,t) = (-)$\nA “spreading out”, or diffusion over time, as the name suggests.\n\n\nSimulating equations\nIf you’ve got this far, you might have noticed that this is written in a jupyter notebook. This allows us to mix code with writing, so we don’t just have to look at an equation to understand how it behaves - we can simulate it directly.\nTo simulate the PDEs, I’m going to use the explicit finite-difference method. It is not the best numerical method to use, but it is easy to code, and provided we keep the time step small enough it will be stable.\nUnder this scheme, we approximate the time derivative as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial a(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{1}{dt}(a_{x,t+1} - a_{x,t})\n\\]\nAnd the spatial part of the derivative (which is usually know as the Laplacian) as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} a(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{dx^{2}}(a_{x+1,t} + a_{x-1,t} - 2a_{x,t})\n\\]\nPutting it all together, for the diffusion part of the equation we get.\n\\[\na_{x,t+1} = a_{x,t} + dt\\left(  \\frac{D_{a}}{dx^{2}}(a_{x+1,t} + a_{x-1,t} - 2a_{x,t})  \\right)\n\\]\nLet’s start by defining some functions to take care of the spatial derivatives. We will be using periodic boundary conditions throughout our exploration, which are easy to implement in numpy using its roll function.\n\n\nimport httpimport\nwith httpimport.github_repo('ijmbarr','turing-patterns'):\n  import tutils\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# I'm using seaborn for it's fantastic default styles\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n\n%matplotlib inline\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n\nfrom tutils import BaseStateSystem\n\n\ndef laplacian1D(a, dx):\n    return (\n        - 2 * a\n        + np.roll(a,1,axis=0)\n        + np.roll(a,-1,axis=0)\n    ) / (dx ** 2)\n\ndef laplacian2D(a, dx):\n    return (\n        - 4 * a\n        + np.roll(a,1,axis=0)\n        + np.roll(a,-1,axis=0)\n        + np.roll(a,+1,axis=1)\n        + np.roll(a,-1,axis=1)\n    ) / (dx ** 2)\n\nTo aid in generating visualisations, I’ve written a base class which updates and plots a system based on some notion of state. There’s nothing specific about the reaction diffusion equations encoded in it, so I’m not going to go into any detail about it. You can find the full code for it, along with this notebook on github here. It uses matplotlib’s animation functionality to plot the output as a gif.\nAll together we can simulate the effect of the diffusion equation:\n\nclass OneDimensionalDiffusionEquation(BaseStateSystem):\n    def __init__(self, D):\n        self.D = D\n        self.width = 1000\n        self.dx = 10 / self.width\n        self.dt = 0.9 * (self.dx ** 2) / (2 * D)\n        self.steps = int(0.1 / self.dt)\n\n    def initialise(self):\n        self.t = 0\n        self.X = np.linspace(-5,5,self.width)\n        self.a = np.exp(-self.X**2)\n\n    def update(self):\n        for _ in range(self.steps):\n            self.t += self.dt\n            self._update()\n\n    def _update(self):\n        La = laplacian1D(self.a, self.dx)\n        delta_a = self.dt * (self.D * La)\n        self.a += delta_a\n\n    def draw(self, ax):\n        ax.clear()\n        ax.plot(self.X,self.a, color=\"r\")\n        ax.set_ylim(0,1)\n        ax.set_xlim(-5,5)\n        ax.set_title(\"t = {:.2f}\".format(self.t))\n\none_d_diffusion = OneDimensionalDiffusionEquation(D=1)\n\none_d_diffusion.plot_time_evolution(\"diffusion.gif\")\n\nMovieWriter imagemagick unavailable; using Pillow instead.\n\n\n\n\n\ndiffusion\n\n\nAs expected - the diffusion equation causes the the concentration to “spread out”.\n\n\nReaction\nInteractions between the two chemical components are introduced via the functions \\(R_{a}\\) and \\(R_{b}\\). These functions only depend on the local concentration of each of the chemicals. Their exact form will depend on the chemicals involved, but it is possible to show that Turing patterns are observed for a whole class of different equations.\nThe one thing we will require from these equations is that they reach a stable equilibrium when the concentrations of the chemicals involved are completely homogeneous. This means that there exists concentrations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that\n\\(R_a(a_{0}, b_{0}) = 0\\)\n\\(R_{b}(a_{0}, b_{0}) = 0\\)\nThe fact that we require this to hold will make the later instability more suprising.\nFor the reaction equations, I’m going to use the FitzHugh–Nagumo equation\n\\(R_a(a, b) = a - a^{3} - b + \\alpha\\)\n\\(R_{b}(a, b) = \\beta (a - b)\\)\nWhere \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are constants.\nLet’s see how it behaves\n\nclass ReactionEquation(BaseStateSystem):\n    def __init__(self, Ra, Rb):\n        self.Ra = Ra\n        self.Rb = Rb\n        self.dt = 0.01\n        self.steps = int(0.1 / self.dt)\n\n    def initialise(self):\n        self.t = 0\n        self.a = 0.1\n        self.b = 0.7\n        self.Ya = []\n        self.Yb = []\n        self.X = []\n\n    def update(self):\n        for _ in range(self.steps):\n            self.t += self.dt\n            self._update()\n\n    def _update(self):\n        delta_a = self.dt * self.Ra(self.a,self.b)\n        delta_b = self.dt * self.Rb(self.a,self.b)\n\n        self.a += delta_a\n        self.b += delta_b\n\n    def draw(self, ax):\n        ax.clear()\n\n        self.X.append(self.t)\n        self.Ya.append(self.a)\n        self.Yb.append(self.b)\n\n        ax.plot(self.X,self.Ya, color=\"r\", label=\"A\")\n        ax.plot(self.X,self.Yb, color=\"b\", label=\"B\")\n        ax.legend()\n\n        ax.set_ylim(0,1)\n        ax.set_xlim(0,5)\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"t\")\n        ax.set_ylabel(\"Concentrations\")\n\nalpha, beta =  0.2, 5\n\ndef Ra(a,b): return a - a ** 3 - b + alpha\ndef Rb(a,b): return (a - b) * beta\n\none_d_reaction = ReactionEquation(Ra, Rb)\none_d_reaction.plot_time_evolution(\"reaction.gif\", n_steps=50)\n\nMovieWriter imagemagick unavailable; using Pillow instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\nThe system is stable, and stabilises to \\(a = b = \\sqrt[3]{\\alpha}\\)."

    "text": "Stability Analysis\nLet’s return to the original equations. We’ve seen that for certain conditions, pattern formations occurs.\nUnfortunately, solving the equations directly for non-linear reaction functions is often not possible. Instead we can look at what happens when the the system is perturbed slightly from equilibrium.\n\nLinearising the Equations\nWe start by assuming there is some concentrations, \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(b_{0}\\), for which the system is stable. This means that - \\(R_{a}(a_{0},b_{0}) = 0\\) - \\(R_{b}(a_{0},b_{0}) = 0\\)\nAround these solutions, we look at the time dependence of small perturbations around these values - \\(x = a - a_{0}\\) - \\(y = b - b_{0}\\)\nAnd linearise the reaction equations - \\(R_{a}(a,b) \\approx r_{aa}x + r_{ab}y\\) - \\(R_{b}(a,b) \\approx r_{ba}x + r_{bb}y\\)\nwhere \\(r_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial R_{i}}{\\partial j}\\).\nThese approximations give us a set of linear equations, written in vector form as\n\\(\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = D\\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{x} + R \\mathbf{x}\\)\nWhere \\(R = \\left(\\begin{matrix} r_{11} & r_{12} \\\\ r_{21} & r_{22}\\end{matrix}\\right)\\) and \\(D = \\left(\\begin{matrix} D_{a} & 0 \\\\ 0 & D_{b}\\end{matrix}\\right)\\)\n\n\nFourier Transform\nIf we impose periodic boundary conditions to this equation, a natural solution can be found by applying a Fourier Transformation to \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). If we call the reciprocal coordinate \\(k\\), and the Fourier transform of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) as \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\), then the transformed equation is\n\\(\\dot{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}} = (R - k^{2}D) \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\)\nWhich, has solutions of the form\n\\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(0) e^{\\omega t}\\)\nTo find \\(\\omega\\) we plug this solution back into our transformed equation to get\n\\(\\omega \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} = (R - k^{2}D) \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\)\nShowing that \\(\\omega\\) is just the eigenvalue of \\((R - k^{2}D)\\).\n\n\nStability\nWe now have an equation for the time dependence of our system in the Fourier domain. Using it, we can now discuss what we mean by stability. Our system is considered stable if small perturbations around the homogeneous do not cause it to move further away from the stable solutions.\nIn terms of our solution, \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}(0) e^{\\omega t}\\), stability means that the values of \\(\\omega\\) does not have positive real parts for all values of \\(k\\). If \\(\\omega\\) is negative, the perturbation will decay away. If \\(\\omega\\) is imaginary, it will oscillate around the stable state. However, if it is positive and real any small perturbation will grow exponentially, until a high order term of the reaction equation becomes important.\nTo find \\(\\omega\\), we need to solve the equation\n$(R - k^{2}D - I) = 0 $\nWriting \\(J = R - k^{2}D\\), this equitation takes the form\n\\(\\omega^{2} - \\omega\\hbox{Tr}(J) + \\hbox{Det}(J) = 0\\)\nSolving for \\(\\omega\\), we get\n\\(\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}(\\hbox{Tr}(J) \\pm \\sqrt{\\hbox{Tr}(J)^{2} - 4 \\hbox{Det}(J) })\\)\n\n\nConditions for (in)Stability\nFrom our initial assumption that there was a stable homogeneous state, we require that \\(\\omega\\) has negative real parts where \\(k = 0\\), which corresponds to the spatially homogeneous solution. For this to be true, we require that\n\n\\(\\hbox{Tr}(R) &lt; 0\\)\n\\(\\hbox{det}(R) &gt; 0\\)\n\nOr, in terms of the components of \\(R\\): - \\(r_{aa} + r_{bb} &lt; 0\\) - \\(r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba} &gt; 0\\)\nFor an instability to now occur at finite wavelength, we need one of the following conditions to hold: - \\(\\hbox{Tr}(J) &gt; 0\\) - \\(\\hbox{det}(J) &lt; 0\\)\nBecause \\(\\hbox{Tr}(J) = \\hbox{Tr}(R) - k^{2}(d_{a} + d_{b})\\), the first condition cannot hold for any real \\(k\\). This means the we require the second to hold, or, after a bit of algebra\n\\(k^{4}d_{a}d_{b} - k^{2}(d_{a}r_{bb} + d_{b}r_{aa}) + (r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba}) &lt; 0\\)\nfor some real value of \\(k\\). Once again, we need to solve a quadratic equation. To do this we note that because \\(k\\) needs to be real, \\(k^{2}\\) must be positive. This means that at least one root of quadratic equation in \\(k^{2}\\) needs to be positive and real. This condition is only met when\n\\(d_{b}r_{aa} + d_{a}r_{bb} &gt; 2\\sqrt{d_{a}d_{b}(r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba})} &gt; 0\\)\nAnd that’s it. We’ve derived that conditions for the diffusion-reaction equations to be stable to small perturbations.\nWe can write the complete requirements as\n\n\\(r_{aa} + r_{bb} &lt; 0\\)\n\\(r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba} &gt; 0\\)\n\\(d_{b}r_{aa} + d_{a}r_{bb} &gt; 2\\sqrt{d_{a}d_{b}(r_{aa}r_{bb} - r_{ab}r_{ba})} &gt; 0\\)\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe’ve waded through a lot of maths to reach this point. Let’s take stock of what we can make of the conditions for instability that we have derived.\nGiven the diffusion coefficients are positive, from the first and third equation above, we know that \\(r_{aa}\\) and \\(r_{bb}\\) have to have different signs, and the component with the negative sign has to be larger. Combining this we the second equation we know that either \\(r_{ab}\\) or \\(r_{ba}\\) has to be negative, and the other has to be positive. This two facts show why some systems like this are called activator-inhibitor system: the presence of one component increase the production of itself - the other inhibits the production of both.\nWith this information, the third equation shows us that the diffusion coefficients need to be different. Specifically, the diffusion coefficient of the inhibitor has to be larger then that of the activator.\nTogether, this gives us a hand-waving explanation of what might be going on: Consider starting with a small increase in the activator at some point. This in turn creates an increase in the inhibitor at that point. Both of these chemical diffuse to nearby points, but the inhibitor diffuses faster, lowering the activator concentration of nearby points. This lowering of the activator concentration at nearby points, which in turn lowers the inhibitor concentration. The disturbance spreads out like a wave.\nIt is a lot easier to get a feel for what’s going on once we visualise the this perturbation:\n\nDa, Db, alpha, beta = 1, 100, -0.005, 10\n\ndef Ra(a,b): return a - a ** 3 - b + alpha\ndef Rb(a,b): return (a - b) * beta\n\ndef initalise_bump(shape):\n    a  = np.zeros(shape)\n    if len(a.shape) == 1:\n        a[int(a.shape[0] / 2)] = 0.3\n    elif len(a.shape) == 2:\n        a[int(a.shape[0] / 2), int(a.shape[1] / 2)] = 0.3\n\n    return(\n        a,\n        np.zeros(shape)\n    )\n\nwidth = 100\ndx = 1\ndt = 0.001\n\nOneDimensionalRDEquations(\n    Da, Db, Ra, Rb,\n    initialiser=initalise_bump,\n    width=width, dx=dx, dt=dt,\n    steps=250\n).plot_time_evolution(\"1dRD_initial_bump.gif\", n_steps=150)\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Parameter Space\nIt is interesting to ask how the parameters of the equations affect the pattern formation. To get a feel for what this dependence is, we can investigate the amplitude of the instability for different frequencies. Close to equilibrium, we expect the frequency with the largest real component to dominate the dynamics of the system.\nCalculating this value isn’t mathematically difficult: we have an equation of the amplitude \\(\\omega\\) in terms of the frequency \\(k\\) above. Differentiating an equation of this size by hand can become tedious due to its size, and it is easy to introduce errors. And why carry out simple replacement steps when we have a computer to hand?\nIn the following, I use the computer algebra system sympy to find the largest real mode of the system\n\nimport sympy as sp\nsp.init_printing()\n\n# define symbols\na,b,alpha,beta = sp.symbols(\"a,b,alpha,beta\")\nRaa, Rab, Rba, Rbb = sp.symbols(\"Raa, Rab, Rba, Rbb\")\nDa, Db = sp.symbols(\"Da, Db\")\nk2 = sp.Symbol(\"k2\")\n\n# create matricies\nR = sp.Matrix(\n    [[Raa, Rab],\n     [Rba, Rbb]]\n)\n\nD = sp.Matrix(\n    [[Da, 0],\n     [0, Db]]\n)\n\nJ = (R - k2 * D)\n\n# define our solution for omega\nomega = sp.Matrix.trace(J) + sp.sqrt(sp.Matrix.trace(J) ** 2 - 4 * sp.Matrix.det(J))\nomega\n\n\\[- Da k_{2} - Db k_{2} + Raa + Rbb + \\sqrt{- 4 Da Db k_{2}^{2} + 4 Da Rbb k_{2} + 4 Db Raa k_{2} - 4 Raa Rbb + 4 Rab Rba + \\left(- Da k_{2} - Db k_{2} + Raa + Rbb\\right)^{2}}\\]\n\n\n\n# find the maximum value of omega for k^{2}\nomega_prime = sp.diff(omega, k2)\nsols = sp.solvers.solve(omega_prime, k2)\nmax_k2 = sols[0]\n\nmax_k2\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{Da Db \\left(Da - Db\\right)} \\left(Da Db Raa - Da Db Rbb - Da \\sqrt{- Da Db Rab Rba} - Db \\sqrt{- Da Db Rab Rba}\\right)\\]\n\n\n\ndef get_length_scale(al, be, da, db):\n\n    # rewritng in terms of Da, Db, alpha, beta\n    Ra = a - a**3 - b + alpha\n    Rb = beta * (a - b)\n\n    # we expand around the homogenius steady state\n    zero_subs = [\n        (a, sp.sign(alpha) * sp.cbrt(sp.Abs(alpha))),\n        (b, sp.sign(alpha) * sp.cbrt(sp.Abs(alpha)))\n    ]\n\n    # and linearise\n    R_prime_subs = {\n        (Raa, sp.diff(Ra, a)),\n        (Rab, sp.diff(Ra, b)),\n        (Rba, sp.diff(Rb, a)),\n        (Rbb, sp.diff(Rb, b))\n    }\n\n    # putting in our numeric values we get\n    vals = [\n        (alpha, al),\n        (beta, be),\n        (Da, da),\n        (Db, db)\n    ]\n\n    # substitute it all in to find the maximum k\n    max_k2 = [sp.N(\n        sol\n        .subs(R_prime_subs)\n        .subs(zero_subs)\n        .subs(vals)\n    ) for sol in sols]\n\n    k2 = max(sp.re(sym) for sym in max_k2)\n\n    # if k2 is negative, no real solution exists\n    if k2 &lt;= 0:\n        return -1\n\n    # convert k2 into length units\n    return sp.N(2 * sp.pi / sp.sqrt(k2))\n\nget_length_scale(-0.005, 10, 1, 100)\n\n\\[13.6336345738685\\]\n\n\nWhich looks about right when we compare it to our simulations above - the spatial variation is about 14 length units.\nLet’s use it to see how the length scale of the system changes as a function of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\):\n\nbetas = [(1 + i) * 0.125 for i in range(0,40)]\nalphas = [i * 0.05 for i in range(-20,20)]\n\noutcomes = np.zeros((len(betas), len(alphas)))\n\nfor x,al in enumerate(alphas):\n    for y,be in enumerate(betas):\n        outcomes[y,x] = get_length_scale(al, be, 1, 100)\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\n\no = outcomes\no[outcomes == 0] = -1\n\nplt.imshow(o, cmap=\"hsv\", interpolation=\"none\")\nplt.colorbar()\n\nplt.xticks(*zip(*[(n,l) for n,l in enumerate(alphas) if n % 5 == 0]), rotation=90)\nplt.yticks(*zip(*[(n,l) for n,l in enumerate(betas) if n % 5 == 0]), rotation=0)\n\nplt.title(\"Lengthscale\", fontsize=20)\nplt.xlabel(r\"$\\alpha$\", fontsize=18)\nplt.ylabel(r\"$\\beta$\", fontsize=18);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd take a look at the long length scale we should see when we use a low value of \\(\\beta\\):\n\nDa, Db, alpha, beta = 1, 100, 0.01, 0.25\n\ndef Ra(a,b): return a - a ** 3 - b + alpha\ndef Rb(a,b): return (a - b) * beta\n\nwidth = 200\ndx = 1\ndt = 0.001\n\nTwoDimensionalRDEquations(\n    Da, Db, Ra, Rb,\n    width=width, height=width,\n    dx=dx, dt=dt, steps=150\n).plot_evolution_outcome(\"2dRD_small_beta.png\", n_steps=100)\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\nInitial Conditions\nAdjusting the parameters gives us control over the length scale of the system.

    "text": "Similar Systems\nTuring patterns are only one part of pattern generation from non-linear PDEs. Given we have the tools to explore these systems, it is worth looking at another simple system in which pattern formation occurs: the Gray-Scott equations. As described in the paper Complex Patterns in a Simple System, for an interesting set of initial conditions the Gray-Scott equations result in a range complex patterns being formed.\nWhile these equations are reaction-diffusion equations, the patterns that end up being formed are not from Turing instabilities. Instead they come from the initial conditions of the system: a small region in the centre of the region is perturbed. As this perturbation spreads out, strange patterns are formed.\nTo visualise it, we just need to pass another initialisation function of our previous class, and put in new reaction equations. The parameters for the interesting systems are taken from here. I’m not currently aware of any theory that gives a full explanation of these patterns.\n\ndef gs_initialiser(shape):\n        a = np.ones(shape)\n        b = np.zeros(shape)\n        centre = int(shape[0] / 2)\n\n        a[centre-20:centre+20,centre-20:centre+20] = 0.5\n        b[centre-20:centre+20,centre-20:centre+20] = 0.25\n\n        a += np.random.normal(scale=0.05, size=shape)\n        b += np.random.normal(scale=0.05, size=shape)\n\n        return a,b\n\n# interesting parameters taken from http://www.aliensaint.com/uo/java/rd/\nparams = [\n    [0.16, 0.08, 0.035, 0.065],\n    [0.14, 0.06, 0.035, 0.065],\n    [0.16, 0.08, 0.06, 0.062],\n    [0.19, 0.05, 0.06, 0.062],\n    [0.16, 0.08, 0.02, 0.055],\n    [0.16, 0.08, 0.05, 0.065],\n    [0.16, 0.08, 0.054, 0.063],\n    [0.16, 0.08, 0.035, 0.06]\n]\n\nfor i, param in enumerate(params):\n\n    Da, Db, f, k = param\n\n    def Ra(a,b): return - a*b*b + f*(1-a)\n    def Rb(a,b): return + a*b*b - (f+k)*b\n\n    width = 200\n    dx = 1\n    dt = 1\n\n    TwoDimensionalRDEquations(\n        Da, Db, Ra, Rb,\n        initialiser=gs_initialiser,\n        width=width, height=width,\n        dx=dx, dt=dt, steps=200\n    ).plot_evolution_outcome(\"gs_{}.png\".format(i), n_steps=100)\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction\n\n\n\n\n\nreaction"

I have some ideas about how we might search for these automatically, but that will have to wait for another post.\nThe complexity that can arise from these simple systems surprised me at fist, but it has been shown that it is possible to encode cellular automata in reaction diffusion systems. This suggests that the patterns formed by reaction-diffusion systems can be as complex as those produced by any Turing-complete system, and that any attempt to provide a quantitative explanation for their full behaviour will eventually run into some undecidable statement.\nAnd with that connection between Turing’s work on reaction-diffusion equations and his more well known work on computability, I think it’s time to end this post."

This can be represented in the modified transition matrix: \\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.5 & 0.32 & 0.3\\\\\n0.2 & 0.48 & 0.1\\\\\n0.3 & 0.2 & 0.6\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\).\nAdvertising Campaign 2 convinces 20% of customers who would have to stay in C to switch to A.

Each pair of histogram denotes the distribution of the market shares for A after some years. The estimated market share values after the set amount of years is denoted under the title. This estimated value is the mu parameter for the Gaussian fit, denoting the value with the greatest probabiltiy distribution.\nFor Advertising Campaign 1, we see that for 1000 random initial distributions of market shares will tend with each iteration towards a stationary state of 0.38 for the market share of A. This suggests that Advertising Campaign 1 will allow A to stabilize at 0.3806 marketshares. This seems to be a very good strategy.\nFor Advertising Campaign 2, we can see that the most probable market share distribution for also increases. With long iterations under numerous random intial states, A seems to always achieve the stationary state of 0.39 for its market share.\nEven after three years, markov simulation suggests that Advertising Campaign 2 performs better than Advertising Campaign 1, as the market share of A under Advertising Campaign 2 is bigger than the market share of A under Advertising Campaign 1. The later iterations also suggests the same thing. Therefore, my model suggests that Advertising Campaign 2 is a more effective choice both for long term and short term increase in market share for A.\n\nI agree with these conclusions.\n\nCan you discuss why these results had to happen, given the specific transition matrices you had? For instance, you are multiplying by the same matrices many times. What do you see if you simply look at the matrix exponents?\n\nAlso: there seems to be a problem with the histograms I see after 50 and 100 years. What’s going on? Did you see this on your end? Is there something else you could do to represent these data better?\n\nIt is important to note the limitations within this model. First, it simplifies the dynamics of the market. By iterating the static transition matrices over long periods of time, we are assuming that the market does not change. In other words, company B and company C are doing nothing to regain their lost customers. After all, it is quite unreasonable to assume that things will always stay the same in 100 years. The effectiveness of the advertising campaign also can change, which is not reflected in the static transition matrices. Therefore, this model may be effect in approximating the effects of the advertising campaigns for a very short period of iteration before competitors B and C have a chance to react or implement their own strategies.\nNow, perhaps we wish to go a step further and analyze how much of an effect gaining shares from B or C will have on the long term share of A. Then, we can simply construct functions of A market share with respect to the gaining of the market share of B or C.\n\n# The variable parameter will be a number between 0 and 1, denoting up till\n# 100% of the customer that was suppose to remain with B going to A\n# Iterations will control how many years passes.\ndef functionB(parameter, iterations, initialState):\n  change = parameter * 0.4\n  transitionMatrix = np.array([[0.5, 0.2 + change, 0.3], [0.2, 0.6 - change, 0.1], [0.3, 0.2, 0.6]])\n  # We will start with the assumption for equal shares.\n  for year in range(iterations):\n    initialState = transitionMatrix.dot(initialState)\n  return initialState[0]\n\ndef functionC(parameter, iterations, initialState):\n  change = parameter * 0.4\n  transitionMatrix = np.array([[0.5, 0.2, 0.3 + change], [0.2, 0.6, 0.1], [0.3, 0.2, 0.6 - change]])\n  # We will start with the assumption for equal shares\n  for year in range(iterations):\n    initialState = transitionMatrix.dot(initialState)\n  return initialState[0]\n\n# Setting the initial state to be all companies having equal shares\ninitialState = np.ones((3,1)) / 3\n\n# Readying the plot\nxValues = np.linspace(0,1, num=101)\nBValues = []\nCValues = []\n\nfor x in xValues:\n  BValues.append(functionB(x, 50, initialState))\n  CValues.append(functionC(x, 50, initialState))\n\n# Plotting\nplt.title(\"Market Share of A after 50 years with Respect to Change in Parameter x\")\nplt.plot(xValues, BValues, label=\"Parameter under Advertisement 1 (B to A)\")\nplt.plot(xValues, CValues, label=\"Parameter under Advertisement 2 (C to A)\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Parameter (Percent Change / 100)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Market Share for A\")\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper left\", frameon=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph works is generated by the following method. We introduce the parameter variable that ranges from 0 to 1. For each transition matrix representing the advertisement matrix, the parameter looks at the percentage of customers going to A rather than staying in B/C from the effects of the campaign and multiplies it by the parameter. For example, if the parameter is 1, than for Advertisement 1, 100% of the customers that was originally going to stay with B will go to A, resulting in the following transition matrix: \\(\\begin{bmatrix}\n0.5 & 0.8 & 0.3\\\\\n0.2 & 0.0 & 0.1\\\\\n0.3 & 0.2 & 0.6\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\\).\n\n\nI love this - it’s a very concrete example which makes it very clear what you are doing.\nNow, with the modified transition matrix by the parameter, the initial state of all companies having equal shares\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{3}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nis initialized. We apply the initial state to the modified transition matrix for 50 times. The resulting market share value of A is then recorded and plotted.\nLooking at the graph, if the resources needed to convert customers from C to A is the same as the resources needed to convert customers from B to A, then it is more effective to convert customers from C since the increase in the market share of A is more for C than B as we increase the parameter.\n\nThis is nicely done and very clear overall. I think you could push a little more on the why; why does Campaign 2 work better, how can you tell just from looking at the transition matrix?\nGrade: E\n\n\n\nSports Ranking\nWe will first rank the teams based on their win-loss ratio. This will be the simplest way to rank them. In fact, we can create a digraph with the given edges before doing so. This allows us to create an adjacency matrix. The sum of the \\(i^{th}\\) row of the matrix gives us the number of wins for team \\(i\\), while the sum of the \\(i^{th}\\) column of the matrix gives us the number of losses for team \\(i\\). Therefore, to account for both wins and losses of each team, we can create a ranking score for each team determined by their number of wins subtracted by their number of losses. Using the adjacency matrix of the graph we created makes our life a lot easier, so I am introducing the graph before the simple ranking.\n\n\nNot really important, but what you do isn’t actually a win-loss ratio…\n\nsportsGraph = nx.DiGraph()\n\nsportsGraph.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\nedges = [\n\n    (1, 2), (7, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (3, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 2), (2, 6),\n\n    (3, 4), (7, 4), (5, 7), (6, 4), (3, 5), (5, 6), (7, 1), (5, 2), (7, 6),\n\n    (1, 4), (6, 3)\n\n]\n\nsportsGraph.add_edges_from(edges)\n\n# Let us plot the graph representing the wins and losses of the 7 teams.\nnx.draw_circular(sportsGraph, with_labels=True)\nplt.show()\n\n# To calculate the win-losses for the teams, we can do it by hand, but it is easier to analyze the adjacency matrix of the graph.\nadj_matrix = nx.adjacency_matrix(sportsGraph)\nadj_matrix = adj_matrix.toarray()\n\n# Define the win and loss arrays, where the index+1 denotes the team number:\nwins = np.zeros(7)\nlosses = np.zeros(7)\n\n# The ith column of the adjacency matrix is the number of losses team i experienced. The ith row is the number of wins team i experienced.\nfor i in range(len(wins)):\n  wins[i] = adj_matrix[i,:].sum()\n\nfor i in range(len(losses)):\n  losses[i] = adj_matrix[:, i].sum()\n\n# We define a very simple score that takes into account the number of wins and the number of losses for each team. The higher the winLossScore, the better the ranking.\nwinLossScore = wins - losses\n\nsimpleSort = np.argsort(winLossScore)[::-1]\nwLSorted = np.sort(winLossScore)[::-1]\n\nprint(\"\\n\")\nprint(\"Simple ranking of the teams based on win/loss:\")\n\nfor i in range(len(simpleSort)):\n  print(f\"{i+1}: Team {simpleSort[i] + 1} with a win - loss score of {wLSorted[i]}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple ranking of the teams based on win/loss:\n1: Team 7 with a win - loss score of 4.0\n2: Team 5 with a win - loss score of 2.0\n3: Team 3 with a win - loss score of 1.0\n4: Team 6 with a win - loss score of 0.0\n5: Team 1 with a win - loss score of -1.0\n6: Team 2 with a win - loss score of -2.0\n7: Team 4 with a win - loss score of -4.0\n\n\nWe can see that the win-loss score gives us fairly neat ranking. Although we didn’t see the same scores on different teams, we can account for it by developing a system. If two teams have the same score, then we look at their total wins. The team with the most wins will be ranked higher. If they have the same wins, they have to have the same losses (since they have the same win-loss score). In this case, we will have to devise more sophisticated methods for ranking. This is what we do next. We will use the vertex power to rank the teams. Remember, the vertex power is the number of connections of a vertex with length two of less. This allows us to sort of consider the “weight” of the team wins. If team 1 wins team 2, and team 2 wins team 3, then we consider team 1 to be better than team 3 and count that as a “win” for team 1 (lucky!)\n\n\nI’m not sure what you mean by this: ” If they have the same wins, they have to have the same losses (since they have the same win-loss score). In this case, we will have to devise more sophisticated methods for ranking. ”\nThen, we can rank the teams based on this power concept. The team with the highest power will be first place.\n\n# Next, we use the vertex power to rank\n\n# Calculate the power matrix\npowerMatrix = adj_matrix + adj_matrix.dot(adj_matrix)\n\n# This will include all values for the powers of each team i (index)\npowers = np.zeros(7)\n\nfor i in range(len(powers)):\n  powers[i] = powerMatrix[i, :].sum()\n\n# Now, sort the powers\npowerSort = np.argsort(powers)[::-1]\npowersSorted = np.sort(powers)[::-1]\n\n# Printing the sort\nprint(\"Power Ranking of the teams\")\nfor i in range(len(powerSort)):\n  print(f\"{i+1}: Team {powerSort[i] + 1} with a power value of {powersSorted[i]}\")\n\nPower Ranking of the teams\n1: Team 7 with a power value of 16.0\n2: Team 5 with a power value of 16.0\n3: Team 3 with a power value of 10.0\n4: Team 6 with a power value of 9.0\n5: Team 2 with a power value of 6.0\n6: Team 4 with a power value of 5.0\n7: Team 1 with a power value of 5.0\n\n\nWe can see that, compared to the simple ranking based on win-loss scores, the power ranking has all of the places the same except for a switch in the place of team 1, 2, 4. This is interesting. This means that although team 2 has a lower win-loss score than team 1, it has a higher power than team 1. We also note that the power ranking is not satisfactory, as there are two pairs of teams (7 and 5, 4 and 1) that has the same power.\n\n\nWhy does Team 2 have a higher power than Team 1? Can you explain it concretely in terms of games that it won?\nTherefore, we should go further and try the Reverse PageRank method. Remember that the Reverse PageRank uses the adjoint of our original adjacency matrix. So, instead of the original PageRank ranking pages based on ingoing links, we now rank based on outgoing links. In our context, this is what we wish, since the outgoing links from team 1 to team 2 means that team 1 won over team 2. Also, Reverse PageRank involves the inclusion of a teleportation vector. This teleportation vector in this context allows us to encode in some “luck” parameter to all of the teams. Maybe team 1 won team 2 because a member in team 2 had a stomache. The teleportation vector then represents a global correction to the weighing of all wins.\n\n\nThe “luck” idea is an interesting way of describing the teleportation vector; I hadn’t thought of it like this before. I think you could dig in a bit: it gives a little bit of weight to the worldview that the teams really are equally good, and that the observed wins and losses were just due to luck. I think you could\nNow, let’s do the reverse pagerank.\n\ntransitionMatrix = np.zeros(np.shape(adj_matrix))\n\n# Since we are doing the transpose of the adjacent matrix, we can do a small\n# shortcut and simply normalize the column vectors of the adjacement matrix.\n# This is because the transition matrix is the \"normalized\" transpose of the\n# adjacent matrix. We start with the transpose of the adjacent matrix. So this\n# ends up canceling out.\nfor j in range(np.shape(adj_matrix)[1]):\n  sumBuffer = 0\n  for i in range(np.shape(adj_matrix)[0]):\n    sumBuffer += adj_matrix[i,j]\n  for m in range(np.shape(adj_matrix)[0]):\n    if adj_matrix[m,j] &gt; 0:\n      transitionMatrix[m,j] = adj_matrix[m,j] / sumBuffer\n\n# Now, we solve the PageRank equation with our obtained transitionMatrix\nalpha = 0.85\n\nmatrixToSolve = np.eye(7) - alpha * transitionMatrix\ninverse = np.linalg.inv(matrixToSolve)\noneMinusAlphaV = (1 - alpha) * (1/7 * np.ones((7,1)))\nanswer = inverse.dot(oneMinusAlphaV)\n\n#Now we sort the values based on descending order\nreverseIndex = np.argsort(answer, axis=0).flatten()[::-1]\nreverseSort = np.sort(answer, axis=0).flatten()[::-1]\n\n#Printing the results\nprint(\"The ReversePage Algorithm Ranking: \")\nfor i in range(len(answer)):\n  print(f\"{i+1}: Team {reverseIndex[i] + 1} with the value of {np.round(reverseSort[i], decimals=2)}\")\n\nThe ReversePage Algorithm Ranking: \n1: Team 5 with the value of 0.25\n2: Team 7 with the value of 0.18\n3: Team 3 with the value of 0.17\n4: Team 6 with the value of 0.13\n5: Team 4 with the value of 0.13\n6: Team 2 with the value of 0.08\n7: Team 1 with the value of 0.06\n\n\nLet us think about the results of this ReversePage compared to the power ranking. We can see now that when we consider the “stable state”, which is what we determine to be the ranking, Team 5 has higher “ranking score” than Team 7. This suggests that even though Team 5 and Team 7 have the same power, the influence, or the “quality” of the wins for Team 5 is higher than Team 7.\n\n\nI really want to see the why here! In English, why is the quality of the wins for Team 5 higher than Team 7?\nAnother interesting result to recognize is the change in the ranking place for Team 4 and Team 6. Even though the “quality” of their wins are the same, the power, or the amount of their wins differ.\nNow, let us add actual weights to the wins with M.\n\nM = [4, 8, 7, 3, 7, 23, 15, 6, 18, 13, 14, 7, 13, 7, 18, 45, 10, 19, 14, 13]\n\n# Administer the weighing\nindex = 0\nnewMatrix = np.zeros(np.shape(adj_matrix))\nfor coordinate in edges:\n  newMatrix[coordinate[0] - 1, coordinate[1] - 1] = adj_matrix[coordinate[0] - 1, coordinate[1] - 1] * M[index]\n  index += 1\n\n# Calculate the new power matrix\nnewPowerMatrix = newMatrix + newMatrix.dot(newMatrix)\n\n# This will include all values for the powers of each team i (index)\nnewPower = np.zeros(7)\n\nfor i in range(len(newPower)):\n  newPower[i] = newPowerMatrix[i, :].sum()\n\n# Now, sort the powers\nnewPowerSort = np.argsort(newPower)[::-1]\nnewPowersSorted = np.sort(newPower)[::-1]\n\n# Printing the sort\nprint(\"Power ranking with added weighing: \")\nfor i in range(len(newPowerSort)):\n  print(f\"{i+1}: Team {newPowerSort[i] + 1} with a power value of {newPowersSorted[i]}\")\n\nPower ranking with added weighing: \n1: Team 5 with a power value of 2104.0\n2: Team 7 with a power value of 2089.0\n3: Team 2 with a power value of 784.0\n4: Team 6 with a power value of 701.0\n5: Team 3 with a power value of 647.0\n6: Team 4 with a power value of 177.0\n7: Team 1 with a power value of 160.0\n\n\nThe higher the power value for the teams, we can assume that the significance of their win is larger. This means that we know although team 5 had less wins than team 7, team 5’s wins were just so much more rewarding and meaningful. The same could be said with the other teams.\n\nYou’ve done a nice job here, clearly explaining what you did and formatting the output nicely. All that’s missing to make this an E grade is an intuitive explanation in English of why the different algorithms are giving different results in a few specific cases.\n\nGrade: M\n\n\n\nLU Factorization\nLet us construct the Gaussian Elimination Algorithm and record all row exchanges with an index array. The overall idea is as follows: For a given matrix A, we first look at the first column of A and find the first nonzero component for this column vector. If this is not the first row of the column vector, we swap it with the first row of the column vector and record this swap with the index array. Then, we find all of the necessary LU factorization factors needed to make the row values of the column vector below 0, recording the multipliers in an identity matrix. Then, we move on to the 2nd column vector of A and do the same thing.\n\ndef PLUSystemSolver(matrix):\n  # Converting to Numpy array\n  matrix = np.array(matrix)\n  matrixSize = np.shape(matrix)\n\n  # Define the row index vector\n  rowIndexArray = np.array(range(0, matrixSize[0]))\n\n  # Defining the mold for the lower triangular matrix L\n  L = np.eye(matrixSize[0])\n\n  # Due to the construction of the algorthm below, we need to temporary save all of the multipliers and its corresponding\n  # coordinate in the L matrix.

We can see its success in finding the PLU matrices for HW3 Problem 12 and Problem 13.\n\n\nI’d like to see more on the testing and the outputs here. How do we know that the product of the PLU matrices really is the starting matrix? How do we know that U and L are really upper and lower diagonal? (We can see this by eye, but you could say so, or you could test for it.)\n\nIs it possible that your algorithm fails on a matrix that is different from these two?\nNow, let us implement the module that uses this PLU function to solve general linear systems. We will assume that the diagonals for the upper triangular and lower triangular matrices are nonzero. This systemSolver algorithm will take in the square nonsingular matrix and b in the form of a list with the correct dimension (3 numbers in a list for a 3 by 3 nonsingular square matrix).\n\n# Let us first define an upper triangular system solver.\n# b will be a one dimensional array.\ndef upperSolve(matrix, b):\n  # We are assuming that the matrix input is an upper triangular matrix.\n  # The matrix has to be square, so the size we can just get a single number.\n  matrixSize = np.shape(matrix)[0]\n  # Construct an empty solution vector\n  solution = np.zeros(matrixSize)\n\n  # We iterate in the reverse order on the rows\n  for rowIndex in reversed(range(matrixSize)):\n    # The value pointer is the value of the diagonal.\n    valuePointer = matrix[rowIndex, rowIndex]\n    if rowIndex == matrixSize - 1:\n      solution[matrixSize - 1] = b[matrixSize - 1] / valuePointer\n      continue\n\n    solution[rowIndex] = b[rowIndex] / matrix[rowIndex, rowIndex]\n    for index in range(rowIndex + 1, matrixSize):\n      solution[rowIndex] -= matrix[rowIndex, index] * solution[index] / matrix[rowIndex, rowIndex]\n\n  return solution\n\ndef lowerSolve(matrix, b):\n  # This will be similar to the upperSolve algorithm\n  # We are assuming that the matrix input is an upper triangular matrix.\n  # The matrix has to be square, so the size we can just get a single number.\n  matrixSize = np.shape(matrix)[0]\n  # Construct an empty solution vector\n  solution = np.zeros(matrixSize)\n\n  # We iterate in the reverse order on the rows\n  for rowIndex in range(matrixSize):\n    # The value pointer is the value of the diagonal.\n    valuePointer = matrix[rowIndex, rowIndex]\n    if rowIndex == 0:\n      solution[0] = b[0] / valuePointer\n      continue\n\n    solution[rowIndex] = b[rowIndex] / matrix[rowIndex, rowIndex]\n    for index in (range(0, rowIndex)):\n      solution[rowIndex] -= matrix[rowIndex, index] * solution[index] / matrix[rowIndex, rowIndex]\n\n  return solution\n\n# After defining the triangular solvers, we can carry on solving the entire system.\ndef systemSolver(P, L, U, b):\n  matrixSize = np.shape(U)\n\n  # We have (P^-1)LUx = b, so we should first solve for z, where (P^-1)z = b.\n  z = np.linalg.solve(P, b)\n\n  # Then, we have z = LUx.

After generating 10000 random 1 x 10 vectors for b and 10 * 10 nonsingular matrices, the algorithm always matches the linalg solution. We can conclude with confidence that our algorithm works well.\n\n\nI’m quite surprised that your algorithm exactly matches the linag one; I would have thought you’d need to allow for some rounding error. Neat!\nLet us try something. Instead of creating a random matrix everytime, let us just use the same matrix.

The second test, which only calculates P, L, U once is noticeably faster than the first test. My hypothesis was that the second test where we did not create random matrices everytime and used the same matrix could be noticeably shorter. This makes sense, as the advantage of PLU is the fact that once we have PLU, we quickly calculate the solutions corresponding to PLU for any b.\n\n\nThis is awesome.\nNow, we can create our final inverse matrix finder module! The inverseFinder takes in nonsingular square matrices and output the inverse :)\n\ndef inverseFinder(matrix):\n  matrixSize = np.shape(matrix)[0]\n  # First, let us generate the standard coordinate basis that will serve as the\n  # b values to the system\n  bSet = []\n  for i in range(matrixSize):\n    e = np.zeros(matrixSize)\n    e[i] = 1\n    bSet.append(e)\n\n  P, L, U = PLUSystemSolver(matrix)\n\n  # Now we can obtain the solutino set\n  solutionSet = []\n  for b in bSet:\n    solutionSet.append(systemSolver(P, L, U, b))\n\n  transpose = np.array(solutionSet)\n  answer = transpose.T\n  return answer\n\n# Simple test\nprint(inverseFinder(A))\nprint(np.linalg.inv(A))\n\n[[-3.  -1.5  0.5]\n [ 7.   3.  -1. ]\n [ 5.   2.  -1. ]]\n[[-3.  -1.5  0.5]\n [ 7.   3.  -1. ]\n [ 5.   2.  -1. ]]\n\n\nYay, the inverse finder is finished. Similar to the systemSolver algorithm, let us test it more extensively by generating random nonsingular square matrices.\n\ntrueTimes = 0\nfalseTimes = 0\n\n# Testing for 10000 times\nfor i in range(10000):\n  # Generating random 1 x 10 vector for b and 10 * 10 nonsingular matrices\n  randomSquare = generate_random_nonsingular_matrix(10)\n  # Test case\n  if np.linalg.inv(randomSquare).all() != None:\n    if inverseFinder(randomSquare).all() == np.linalg.inv(randomSquare).all():\n      trueTimes += 1\n    else:\n      falseTimes = 0\n  else:\n    print(randomSquare)\n\nprint(\"Number of Times the Algorithm is Correct: \", trueTimes)\nprint(\"Number of Times the Algorithm is Incorrect: \", falseTimes)\n\nNumber of Times the Algorithm is Correct:  10000\nNumber of Times the Algorithm is Incorrect:  0\n\n\nThis code will take a little while to run. But after it finishes, we see that the inverseFinder algorithm works very well! There is no time when the algorithm is wrong during this test. It is important to note the limitations of the algorithm systemSolver and inverseFInder as they can only take square nonsingular matrices. In other words, matrices with a nonzero determinant. However, this is expected as the inverse can only be found for matrices with zero determinant. Therefore, the only big limitation will be for systemSolver. We cannot use this algorithm to solve singular matrices or matrix systems with infinite solutions. However, it is also important to note the strength of these algorithms. It uses a relatively clear and straigtforward process to find the system solution and the inverses. Once the PLU matrices are found, the solutions for the linear system corresponding to PLU for any b can be found with small computing power.\n\nThis is excellent. You’ve created the algorithms and tested them well, including cleverly measuring the effects of using the decomposition for repeated solving. Great work.\nGrade: E"

Thus, we can see that it would be ideal for the company to undergo marketing strategies to implement plan 2. However, we must consider the market distributions: all distributions provided assume no company has more than 50% of the market share. However, as displayed below, even if we start with 0 market share, our new marketing strategy will propel us to the largest market holder within a 10 year period.\n\n\nCode\n(plan2 ** 10) * sp.Matrix([0.0, 0.99, .01])\n\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}0.389923740012833\\\\0.278200270113832\\\\0.331875989873334\\end{matrix}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\nI suspect your conclusions may be correct here – but I can’t tell for sure because I don’t know what the code is doing.\nI get it; this is how my code often looks as well. It’s been a real challenge over the years to train myself to write code that is clear and easy to understand. It’s a skill that takes time to develop, but it’s worth it.\nWhen you want to be able to come back and understand what you’ve done, and especially if you want others to understand what you’ve done, your code will need a bunch of changes.\nFirst, you should look for areas of repeated code and make these into functions.\nThen you should think about how to logically order the functions, and how to name everything so that it’s very clear how your code corresponds to what you are trying to do mathematically. It may be helpful to first write (in Markdown cells) what you are computing, with formulas, and then give the code.\nFinally, you should add comments to your code to explain what each part is doing.\nIf you use an editor that supports CoPilot or a similar AI code editing tool, this can be very helpful: you can take a bit of code and ask the AI to “make this more efficient”. You’ll want to make sure then that you go over it carefully to make sure it’s still correct and that you understand what it’s doing; the AI can do a good job too with “explain this”. For my code, I’ve been using VSCode with the Jupyter extension and the CoPilot plugin, all free. (Alternatively, you could use Quarto, which is a document format that lets you write in Markdown with Python code in blocks. I find it easier to think when I don’t have to put every bit of prose inside its own separate block, but YMMV. For writing these comments, I converted your homework file to Quarto; if you click on “Code” and then “View Source” at the top of this document, you can see what it looks like.)\nOnce you have gotten the code into shape, it would be great to look again at your conclusions and see if you can understand what about the matrices tells you that e.g. Plan 2 really is best for your company.\nGrade: R\n\n\nSports Ranking\n\n\nCode\n# Do imports\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport scipy\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a directed graph\nG = nx.DiGraph()\n\n# Add nodes\nG.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n# Add vertices\nedges = [(1,2),(7,3),(2,4),(4,5),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1),(3,1),(7,2),(2,6), (3, 4), (7,4),(5,7),(6,4),(3,5),(5,6),(7,1),(5,2),(7,6),(1,4),(6,3)]\nG.add_edges_from(edges)\n\n# Draw the graph\nnx.draw_circular(G, with_labels=True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadj_matrix = nx.adjacency_matrix(G).toarray()\nadj_matrix\n\n\narray([[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n       [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n       [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n       [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n       [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Power Matrix\npower_matrix = adj_matrix + adj_matrix ** 2\npower_matrix\n\n\narray([[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0],\n       [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n       [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n       [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n       [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculating team ranking with the power matrix\npower_sum = [sum(power_matrix[i]) for i in range(7)]\nrrank = np.argsort(power_sum)\nrank = np.flip(rrank + 1)\nrank\n\n\narray([7, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 4])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculating team ranking with reverse pagerank: calculate diagonal matrix D\nadjT = adj_matrix.T\nD = np.zeros((7, 7))\nfor i in range(7):\n  D[i][i] = 1 / sum(adjT[i])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Determine P = ATD -&gt; (AT)TD = AD with alpha a = 0.85, teleporation vector 1/7 e_7)\nP = sp.Matrix(sp.Matrix(adj_matrix) * sp.Matrix(D))\na = 0.85\nv = sp.Matrix(np.ones(7) * 1/7)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Solve for x\nM = (sp.eye(7) - a * P)\nb = (1 - a) * v\nsol = M.solve(b)\nx = np.array([sol[i] for i in range(7)], dtype='float')\nx\n\n\narray([0.05966732, 0.07966581, 0.17626964, 0.12535158, 0.24452472,\n       0.13033224, 0.18418869])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Find ranking\npr_rank = np.flip(np.argsort(x))+1\npr_rank\n\n\narray([5, 7, 3, 6, 4, 2, 1])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a weighted directed graph\nG = nx.DiGraph()\n\n# Add nodes\nG.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n# Add vertices\nedges = [(1,2),(7,3),(2,4),(4,5),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1),(3,1),(7,2),(2,6), (3, 4), (7,4),(5,7),(6,4),(3,5),(5,6),(7,1),(5,2),(7,6),(1,4),(6,3)]\nlength = len(edges)\nweight = [4,8,7,3,7,7,23,15,6,18,13,14,7,13,7,18,45,10,19,14,13]\nfor i in range(length):\n  G.add_edge(edges[i][0], edges[i][1], weight=weight[i])\n\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=7)  # positions for all nodes - seed for reproducibility\n\n# nodes\nnx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_size=700)\n\n# edges\nnx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, edgelist=edges, width=1)\n\n# node labels\nnx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=20, font_family=\"sans-serif\")\n# edge weight labels\nedge_labels = nx.get_edge_attributes(G, \"weight\")\nnx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Replace adjacency booleans with weights\nweight_adj = adj_matrix\nfor i in range(length):\n  weight_adj[edges[i][0]-1, edges[i][1]-1] = weight[i]\nweight_adj\n\n\narray([[ 0,  4,  0, 14,  0,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  7,  0, 18,  0],\n       [15,  7,  0, 13,  7,  0,  0],\n       [ 0,  0,  0,  0,  3,  0,  0],\n       [ 7, 10,  0,  0,  0, 18,  7],\n       [23,  0, 13, 13,  0,  0,  0],\n       [45,  6,  8, 14,  0, 19,  0]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\nweight_power = weight_adj + weight_adj**2\nweight_power_sum = [sum(weight_power[i]) for i in range(7)]\nrrank_weight = np.argsort(weight_power_sum)\nrank_weight = np.flip(rrank_weight + 1)\nrank_weight\n\n\narray([7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4])\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculating team ranking with reverse pagerank: calculate diagonal matrix D\nadjT_weight = weight_adj.T\nD = np.zeros((7, 7))\nfor i in range(7):\n  D[i][i] = 1 / sum(adjT_weight[i])\n# Determine P = ATD -&gt; (AT)TD = AD with alpha a = 0.85, teleporation vector 1/7 e_7)\nP = sp.Matrix(sp.Matrix(weight_adj) * sp.Matrix(D))\na = 0.85\nv = sp.Matrix(np.ones(7) * 1/7)\n# Solve for x\nM = (sp.eye(7) - a * P)\nb = (1 - a) * v\nsol = M.solve(b)\nx = np.array([sol[i] for i in range(7)], dtype='float')\n# Find ranking\npr_rank = np.flip(np.argsort(x))+1\npr_rank\n\n\narray([5, 3, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1])\n\n\n\nHere the code is a bit more straightforward, so I’m more able to follow along.

Then, once you have a result, you’ll want to explain what it means and how it relates to the original problem.\nGrade: R\n\n\n\nIso Rank\n\n\nCode\n# Construct adjacency matrices for A,B,C,D,E and 1,2,3,4,5\n# G1 = A,B,C,D,E\n# G2 = 1,2,3,4,5\nnp_G1 = np.matrix([\n    [0,1,1,0,1],\n    [1,0,0,1,0],\n    [1,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,1,0,0,0],\n    [1,0,0,0,0]\n], dtype='float')\nnp_G2 = np.matrix([\n    [0,0,1,0,0],\n    [0,0,1,0,0],\n    [1,1,0,1,0],\n    [0,0,1,0,1],\n    [0,0,0,1,0]\n], dtype='float')\nG1T = np_G1.transpose()\nG2T = np_G2.transpose()\nfor i in range(5):\n  G1T[i] /= np.sum(G1T[i])\n  G2T[i] /= np.sum(G2T[i])\nG1 = sp.Matrix(np.transpose(G1T))\nG2 = sp.Matrix(np.transpose(G2T))\nG2\n\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0\\\\1.0 & 1.0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 1.0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0\\end{matrix}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Construct G2 x G1 (Outer x Inner) surfing matrix\nM = sp.zeros(25)\nfor h in range(5):\n  for k in range(5):\n    for i in range(5):\n      for j in range(5):\n        M[i+5*(h), j+5*(k)] = G2[h, k] * G1[i, j]\nM\n\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{array}{ccccccccccccccccccccccccc}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0.5 & 1.0 & 0 & 1.0 & 0 & 0.5 & 1.0 & 0 & 1.0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.25 & 0.5 & 0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 1.0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 1.0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.25 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 1.0 & 0 & 1.0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 1.0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.111111111111111 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.333333333333333 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.25 & 0.5 & 0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.25 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.166666666666667 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate x given alpha = 0.85, v = 1/25 * e25\na = 0.85\nv = 1/25 * sp.Matrix(np.ones(25))\nmat = (sp.eye(25) -

    "text": "Hi Xiao,\nI think you’ve done a nice job with the coding aspect of these reports. Everything you do is straightforward enough that I can clearly follow it. (For students who are less skilled programmers, they sometimes make very convoluted code which is really hard for me to understand.)\nHowever, I’d like to see much more explanation of what you’re doing and why, from a mathematical perspective. For instance, in the diffusion problem, you could start with a section describing the problem setup and what you are trying to find. Then each time you put a bit of code, you should explain what that code is doing, perhaps giving (in Markdown) the formula that you are implementing.\nIt takes a little while to get used to writing in Markdown when you are used to just commenting within your code; you can be more vebose and write in full sentences, use Latex expressions, etc.\nThen, when you make plots, they should be clearly labeled and you should explain what you are seeing in the plot.\nFinally, I’d like to see you interacting a bit with the ideas that explain why you get the results you get. For instance, in the Markov Chain problem, you could explain how you can tell from the intial matrices which companies are likely to be more profitable in the long run.\n(Regarding the Markov Chain problem – you state that the system will always converge to the same stationary state, which I think is true but in this report I’d like to see you try it by using a few different initial states. Or do a mathematical proof if you have a good idea of how to do that!)\nI’m going to give you a grade of R for each of these projects; I hope you will be able to revise and resubmit them, because the underlying work here is quite good.\n\n\nDiffusion\n\n\nCode\nimport sympy as sym\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nsb = sym.Symbol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nN=7\nM = sym.zeros(N)\nfor i in range(N):\n  if (i&gt;0):\n      M[i-1,i]=1\n  M[i,i]=-2\n  if (i&lt;N-1):\n      M[i+1,i]=1\n  # M[0, i] = 0\n  # M[6, i] = 0\n#   M[i, 0] = 0\n#   M[i, 6] = 0\n# M[5, 6] = 0\nM\n\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}-2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 1\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2\\end{matrix}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nt270 = sym.Matrix([0.0, 0.051, 1.21, 3.48, 1.21, 0.051, 0.0])\n# t270 = sym.Matrix([0.051, 1.21, 3.48, 1.21, 0.051])\n\n\n\n\nCode\nt240 = sym.Matrix([0.0, 0.032, 1.23, 3.69, 1.23, 0.032, 0.0])\n\n\nGoing forward from 240 to 270\n\n\nCode\nDh2 = 0.00004 * 36\n\ncurrent = t240\nfor step in range(240, 271):\n    next_step = current + M*current * Dh2\n    if step % 10 == 0:\n        print(step, current)\n        print('\\n')\n    current = next_step\n\n\n240 Matrix([[0], [0.0320000000000000], [1.23000000000000], [3.69000000000000], [1.23000000000000], [0.0320000000000000], [0]])\n\n\n250 Matrix([[0.000562471243392380], [0.0486924553785851], [1.24759546552771], [3.62029245984376], [1.24759546552771], [0.0486924553785851], [0.000562471243392380]])\n\n\n260 Matrix([[0.00134480689310895], [0.0651618382102242], [1.26395165777253], [3.55305081122375], [1.26395165777253], [0.0651618382102242], [0.00134480689310895]])\n\n\n270 Matrix([[0.00233753410690556], [0.0814003695987503], [1.27913496114619], [3.48817057984740], [1.27913496114619], [0.0814003695987503], [0.00233753410690556]])\n\n\n\n\nBackwards from 270 to 240\n\n\nCode\ncurrent.shape\n\n\n(7, 1)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nDh2 = 0.00004 * 36\n\ncurrent = t270\nfor step in range(270, -1, -1):\n    prev_step = (sym.eye(current.shape[0]) + M* Dh2).inv()*current \n    if step % 40 == 0:\n        print(step, current)\n        print('\\n')\n    current = sym.Matrix(np.maximum(prev_step, 0))\nprint(step, current)\ninit_state = current\n\n\n240 Matrix([[0], [0.00212689488945927], [1.15621985395050], [3.68754809461451], [1.15621985395048], [0.00212689488945964], [0]])\n\n\n200 Matrix([[9.47143103797723e-5], [0], [1.06279149507993], [4.00254036435968], [1.06279149507989], [0], [9.47143103797697e-5]])\n\n\n160 Matrix([[0.000194835210686209], [0], [0.937128531983600], [4.36938971176471], [0.937128531983537], [0], [0.000194835210686203]])\n\n\n120 Matrix([[0.000294410849364334], [0], [0.771792042493187], [4.79882186271244], [0.771792042493099], [0], [0.000294410849364323]])\n\n\n80 Matrix([[0.000389481701770366], [0], [0.557712169649991], [5.30388057840637], [0.557712169649879], [0], [0.000389481701770348]])\n\n\n40 Matrix([[0.000474717247747708], [0], [0.283827585787304], [5.90043223273764], [0.283827585787171], [0], [0.000474717247747682]])\n\n\n0 Matrix([[0.000543077482862398], [8.59904987581519e-5], [0], [6.60726130357147], [0], [8.59904987583709e-5], [0.000543077482862360]])\n\n\n0 Matrix([[0.000544502698002186], [9.92726600399977e-5], [0], [6.62637281796703], [0], [9.92726600402174e-5], [0.000544502698002148]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\ncurrent = init_state\nplot_df = pd.DataFrame([], columns=['0', '1/6', '1/3', '1/2'], dtype=np.float64)\nfor step in range(0, 301):\n    plot_df.loc[step] = current[:4]\n    next_step = current + M*current * Dh2\n    if step==0 or step ==210 or step == 300:\n        print(step, current)\n        print('\\n')\n    current = next_step\nplot_df.loc[step] = current[:4]\n\n\n0 Matrix([[0.000544502698002186], [9.92726600399977e-5], [0], [6.62637281796703], [0], [9.92726600402174e-5], [0.000544502698002148]])\n\n\n210 Matrix([[0.0171961512440258], [0.170658419488325], [1.14714251754697], [3.95457410693089], [1.14714251754697], [0.170658419488326], [0.0171961512440258]])\n\n\n300 Matrix([[0.0390928199813232], [0.277467835539847], [1.32429430615571], [3.33577189136941], [1.32429430615571], [0.277467835539847], [0.0390928199813232]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_df = plot_df.astype(np.float_)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_df.plot(kind='line')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is expected that the center curve looks like an logarithmic decay, the 1/3 curve looks like a logarithmic increase which I suppose will decrease at the point.

It’s great that you noticed a discrepancy in the results and thought about how the initial state might affect the outcome. This is a very insightful analysis that adds depth to your work.\nHow do you think the results might change if you looked further into the future, beyond the 3-year timeline? Would the threshold for the initial market share of B change if you considered a longer time horizon? Would the initial state cease to matter at all?\nI also appreciate the way you’ve presented your results in a clear and concise manner. Great work!\nGrade: E\n\n\n\nCode\n# Sports Ranking Part 1.

Each node represents the circuit space between these objects. and we can attach a potential value to each node, say the potentials are \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{6}\\). The potential difference across an edge is the potential value of head minus tail. Kirchhoff’s second law of electrical circuits says that the sum of potential differences around a circuit loop must be zero. Assume and use the fact (p. 422) that \\(A \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) implies that for all \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathcal{N}\\left(A^{T}\\right), \\mathbf{y}^{T} \\mathbf{b}=0\\) to find conditions that a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must satisfy in order for it to be a vector of potential differences for some potential distribution on the vertices.\nAssume that across each edge of a circuit a current flows. Thus, we can assign to each edge a “weight,” namely the current flow along the edge. This is an example of a weighted digraph. However, not just any set of current weights will do, since Kirchhoff’s first law of circuits says that the total flow of current in and out of any node should be 0 . Use this law to find a matrix condition that must be satisfied by the currents and solve it to exhibit some current flows.\nThink of the digraph as representing a directed communications network. Here loops determine which nodes have bidirectional communication since any two nodes of a loop can only communicate with each other by way of a loop. By examining only a basis of directed loops how could you determine which nodes in the network can communicate with each other?\nThink of vertices of the digraph as representing airports and edges representing flight connections between airports for Gamma Airlines. Suppose further that for each connection there is a maximum number of daily flights that will be allowed by the destination airport from an origin airport and that, in the order that the edges in \\(E\\) are listed above, these limits are\n\\[\nM=\\{4,3,8,7,2,6,7,10,5,8\\} .\n\\]\n\nNow suppose that Gamma wants to maximize the flow of flights into airport 1 and out of airport 6 . Count inflows into an airport as positive and outflows as negative. Assume that the net in/outflow of Gamma flights at each airport 1 to 5 is zero, while the net inflow of such flights into airport 1 matches the net outflow from 6 .\n\nDescribe the problem of maximizing this inflow to airport 1 as a linear programming problem and express it in a standard form (block matrices are helpful.) Note that the appropriate variables are all outflows from one airport to another, i.e., along edges, together with the net inflow into airport 1.\nSolve the problem of part (a). Also solve the reverse problem: Maximize inflow into airport 6 and matching outflow from 1. Explain and justify your answers.\n\n\nWith the same limits on allowable flights into airports as in item 5, suppose that Gamma Airlines wants to determine an allocation of planes that will maximize their profits, given the following constraints: (1) Airports 1 and 6 have repair facilities for their planes, so no limit is placed on the inflow or outflow of their planes other than the airport limits. (2) Flights through airports 2-5 of Gamma planes are pass through, i.e., inflow and outflow must match. (3) Gamma has 32 planes available for this network of airports. (4) The profits per flight in thousands are, in the order that the edges in \\(E\\) are listed above,\n\n\\[\nP=\\{5,6,7,9,10,8,9,5,6,10\\}\n\\] (a) Set this problem up as a linear programming problem in standard form. Clearly identify the variables and explain how the constraints follow.\n\nSolve this problem explicitly and specify the operations taken to do so. Example 3.56 is instructive for this problem, so be aware of it. Use a technology tool that allows you to use elementary operations (ALAMA calculator has this capability)."

    "text": "Project 5 Image Compression and Edge Detection\nProblem Description: In this report you will test some limits of data compression by experimenting with an interesting image of your own choosing. It could be a photograph you have taken or some reasonably complex image from the internet that piqued your interest. You are to transform the image into suitable format and then see how much you can can compress that data storage requirements for that image while losing an acceptable amount of detail.\nImplementation Notes: First, you must convert the image to a grayscale format without layers with pixels stored as unsigned eight bit integers. (We are not going to deal with the additional details of color images.) For this you will need an image manipulation program such as the GNU program Gimp or commercial software such as Adobe Photoshop. Figure 4.7(a) is an example of the sort of file you with which you will start experimenting. Secondly, you will need a technology tool capable of importing standard flattened image grayscale images (such as .png, etc.) into matrices and vice versa. The freely available \\(\\mathrm{R}\\) programming language and Octave, as well as commercial Matlab and others are perfectly capable of these tasks. For the record, Figure 4.7 and its relatives in this chapter were converted from .pdf into grayscale .png images via Gimp and read, manipulated and written as matrices via Octave.\nNext, you must apply the Haar wavelet transform repeatedly to your initial image until you reach a blur that is unacceptably far from the initial image. These computations will require a mild bit of programming on your part with the technology tool of your choice. Each application of the transform will reduce storage requirements by a factor of four. How much are you able to save? Of course, “unacceptably far” is in the eye of the beholder, but here’s a pretty reasonable case: Start with a some text and compress it until you can no longer read the text.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, so be lavish with them in your write-up. Consider the amount of savings if, in addition to saving the blurs in all their detail, you were to to save a very good approximation to the edges portion of the transformed picture. For example, consider what you might achieve by first applying some thresholding condition to edge portions of the picture that sets all pixels below a certain level to zero, then accounting for the large number of resulting zeros by some compression technique. You might even suggest a format for such a compression format."

You will use the data from the games played up to that point to predict the outcome of the season.\nStart by making a table of scores from the games played thus far: The \\((i, j)\\) th entry is team \\(i\\) ’s score in the game with team \\(j\\). (See below for an example.)\nThen, you will want to use the ideas of least squares and graph theory to predict team ratings and point spreads for the remaining games. The idea is to set up a system of equations that will give you the best fit to the observed scores. You will need to use the ideas of least squares to solve this system of equations.

The equations in question are formed by letting the variables be a vector x of “potentials” \\(x(i)\\), one for each team \\(i\\), so that the “potential differences” best approximate the actual score differences (i.e., point spreads) of the games. To find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) of potentials you solve the system \\(A \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the vector of observed potential differences. N.B: the matrix \\(A\\) is not the table given above. You will get one equation for each game played. For example, by checking the \\((1,2)\\) th and \\((2,1)\\) th entries, we see that \\(\\mathrm{CU}\\) beat IS by a score of 24 to 12 . So the resulting equation for this game is \\(x(1)-x(2)=24-12=12\\). Ideally, the resulting potentials would give numbers that would enable you to predict the point spread of an as yet unplayed game: all you would have to do to determine the spread for team \\(i\\) versus team \\(j\\) is calculate the difference \\(x(j)-x(i)\\). Of course, it doesn’t really work out this way, but this is a reasonable use of the known data. When you set up this system, you obtain an inconsistent system. This is where least squares enter the picture. You will need to set up and solve the normal equations, one way or another. You might notice that the null space of the resulting coefficient matrix is nontrivial, so this matrix does not have full column rank. This makes sense: potentials are unique only up to a constant. To fix this, you could arbitrarily fix the value of one team’s potential, that is, set the weakest team’s potential value to zero by adding one additional equation to the system of the form \\(x(i)=0\\)."

Assume and use the fact (p. 422) that \\(A \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) implies that for all \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathcal{N}\\left(A^{T}\\right), \\mathbf{y}^{T} \\mathbf{b}=0\\) to find conditions that a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must satisfy in order for it to be a vector of potential differences for some potential distribution on the vertices.\nAssume that across each edge of a circuit a current flows. Thus, we can assign to each edge a “weight,” namely the current flow along the edge. This is an example of a weighted digraph. However, not just any set of current weights will do, since Kirchhoff’s first law of circuits says that the total flow of current in and out of any node should be 0 . Use this law to find a matrix condition that must be satisfied by the currents and solve it to exhibit some current flows.\nThink of the digraph as representing a directed communications network. Here loops determine which nodes have bidirectional communication since any two nodes of a loop can only communicate with each other by way of a loop. By examining only a basis of directed loops how could you determine which nodes in the network can communicate with each other?\nThink of vertices of the digraph as representing airports and edges representing flight connections between airports for Gamma Airlines. Suppose further that for each connection there is a maximum number of daily flights that will be allowed by the destination airport from an origin airport and that, in the order that the edges in \\(E\\) are listed above, these limits are\n\\[\nM=\\{4,3,8,7,2,6,7,10,5,8\\} .\n\\]\n\nNow suppose that Gamma wants to maximize the flow of flights into airport 1 and out of airport 6 . Count inflows into an airport as positive and outflows as negative. Assume that the net in/outflow of Gamma flights at each airport 1 to 5 is zero, while the net inflow of such flights into airport 1 matches the net outflow from 6 .\n\nDescribe the problem of maximizing this inflow to airport 1 as a linear programming problem and express it in a standard form (block matrices are helpful.) Note that the appropriate variables are all outflows from one airport to another, i.e., along edges, together with the net inflow into airport 1.\nSolve the problem of part (a). Also solve the reverse problem: Maximize inflow into airport 6 and matching outflow from 1. Explain and justify your answers.\n\n\nWith the same limits on allowable flights into airports as in item 5, suppose that Gamma Airlines wants to determine an allocation of planes that will maximize their profits, given the following constraints: (1) Airports 1 and 6 have repair facilities for their planes, so no limit is placed on the inflow or outflow of their planes other than the airport limits. (2) Flights through airports 2-5 of Gamma planes are pass through, i.e., inflow and outflow must match. (3) Gamma has 32 planes available for this network of airports. (4) The profits per flight in thousands are, in the order that the edges in \\(E\\) are listed above,\n\n\\[\nP=\\{5,6,7,9,10,8,9,5,6,10\\}\n\\] (a) Set this problem up as a linear programming problem in standard form. Clearly identify the variables and explain how the constraints follow.\n\nSolve this problem explicitly and specify the operations taken to do so. Example 3.56 is instructive for this problem, so be aware of it. Use a technology tool that allows you to use elementary operations (ALAMA calculator has this capability)."

Consider the amount of savings if, in addition to saving the blurs in all their detail, you were to to save a very good approximation to the edges portion of the transformed picture. For example, consider what you might achieve by first applying some thresholding condition to edge portions of the picture that sets all pixels below a certain level to zero, then accounting for the large number of resulting zeros by some compression technique.

    "text": "3. Least Squares\nPick a league in a sport that you like. For example, you could pick the WNBA for basketball, or a soccer league. Pick a point halfway through last year’s season. You will use the data from the games played up to that point to predict the outcome of the season.\nStart by making a table of scores from the games played thus far: The \\((i, j)\\) th entry is team \\(i\\) ’s score in the game with team \\(j\\). (See below for an example.)\nThen, you will want to use the ideas of least squares and graph theory to predict team ratings and point spreads for the remaining games. The idea is to set up a system of equations that will give you the best fit to the observed scores. You will need to use the ideas of least squares to solve this system of equations. (See below for more details.)\nFinally, write a brief report on your project that describes the problem, your solution to it, its limitations, and the ideas behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{CU}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{IS}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{KS}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{KU}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{MU}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{NU}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{OS}\\)\n\\(\\mathrm{OU}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{CU}\\)\n\n24\n\n21\n45\n\n21\n14\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{IS}\\)\n12\n\n\n42\n21\n16\n\n7\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{KS}\\)\n\n\n\n12\n21\n3\n27\n24\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{KU}\\)\n9\n14\n30\n\n\n10\n\n14\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{MU}\\)\n8\n3\n52\n\n\n18\n21\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{NU}\\)\n\n51\n48\n63\n26\n\n63\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{OS}\\)\n41\n\n45\n\n49\n42\n\n28\n\n\n\\(\\mathrm{OU}\\)\n17\n35\n70\n63\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\nImplementation Notes: You will need to set up a suitable system of equations, form the normal equations, and have a technology tool solve the problem. The equations in question are formed by letting the variables be a vector x of “potentials” \\(x(i)\\), one for each team \\(i\\), so that the “potential differences” best approximate the actual score differences (i.e., point spreads) of the games. To find the vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) of potentials you solve the system \\(A \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is the vector of observed potential differences. N.B: the matrix \\(A\\) is not the table given above. You will get one equation for each game played. For example, by checking the \\((1,2)\\) th and \\((2,1)\\) th entries, we see that \\(\\mathrm{CU}\\) beat IS by a score of 24 to 12 . So the resulting equation for this game is \\(x(1)-x(2)=24-12=12\\). Ideally, the resulting potentials would give numbers that would enable you to predict the point spread of an as yet unplayed game: all you would have to do to determine the spread for team \\(i\\) versus team \\(j\\) is calculate the difference \\(x(j)-x(i)\\). Of course, it doesn’t really work out this way, but this is a reasonable use of the known data. When you set up this system, you obtain an inconsistent system. This is where least squares enter the picture. You will need to set up and solve the normal equations, one way or another. You might notice that the null space of the resulting coefficient matrix is nontrivial, so this matrix does not have full column rank. This makes sense: potentials are unique only up to a constant. To fix this, you could arbitrarily fix the value of one team’s potential, that is, set the weakest team’s potential value to zero by adding one additional equation to the system of the form \\(x(i)=0\\)."

You can see how this result changes if you use floating point numbers at some point in the calculation, e.g. x = N(x).)\n\nfrom sympy import Matrix, Rational\n\n# Set up the matrix A in symbolic form\nA = Matrix([[1, Rational(6, 100), Rational(12, 100)], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])\n\n\nDoing it with numpy:\n\nimport numpy as np\nA = np.array([[1, 0.06, 0.12], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])\n# find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)\nprint(eigenvalues)\nprint(eigenvectors)\n\n[ 1.14411531+0.j         -0.07205766+0.31574076j -0.07205766-0.31574076j]\n[[ 0.65266846+0.j          0.08945851+0.04307557j  0.08945851-0.04307557j]\n [ 0.57045689+0.j          0.0682135 -0.29889653j  0.0682135 +0.29889653j]\n [ 0.49860087+0.j         -0.94665171+0.j         -0.94665171-0.j        ]]\n\n\n\nx = eigenvectors[2]\n# pick a random initial vector\nx = np.random.rand(3)\nfor i in range(10):\n    xnew = A @ x\n    print(xnew[0] / x[0])\n    x = xnew\n\n1.5369501393593878\n1.2152748467897423\n1.1136176755844605\n1.142547212360476\n1.1468271144564486\n1.1439000530317671\n1.1439256174937906\n1.1441564621544824\n1.1441253281684178\n1.1441107512822049\n\n\nDoing it with sympy:\n\nfrom sympy import Matrix, symbols, randprime, Rational,N\nfrom sympy.abc import x\n\n\nA = Matrix([[1, Rational(6, 100), Rational(12, 100)], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])\n\n\n# find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\neigenvalues = A.eigenvals()\neigenvectors = A.eigenvects()\n\nprint(\"Eigenvalues:\")\nfor value in eigenvalues:\n    print(value)\n\nprint(\"\\nEigenvectors:\")\nfor vector in eigenvectors:\n    print(vector)\n\n# pick a random initial vector\n#x = Matrix([randprime(1, 10) for _ in range(3)])\n\n# use the third eigenvector as the initial\nx = eigenvectors[0][2][0]\n\nfor i in range(100):\n    #xnew = N(A * x)\n    xnew= A * x\n    growth_rate = N(xnew[0] / x[0])\n    print(f\"Growth rate at iteration {i}: {growth_rate}\")\n    x = xnew\n\nEigenvalues:\n59/(450*(sqrt(20707)/1500 + 289/2700)**(1/3)) + 1/3 + (sqrt(20707)/1500 + 289/2700)**(1/3)\n1/3 + 59/(450*(-1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2)*(sqrt(20707)/1500 + 289/2700)**(1/3)) + (-1/2 + sqrt(3)*I/2)*(sqrt(20707)/1500 + 289/2700)**(1/3)\n1/3 + (-1/2 -

Assume that these birds have at most a 6-year life span. It is estimated that the survival rates for birds in groups 1 and 2 are \\(50 \\%\\) and 75%, respectively. Also, birds in groups 1, 2, and 3 produce 0,1 , and 3 offspring on average in any biennium (period of 2 years).\n\nModel this bird population as a discrete dynamical system and analyze the long-term change in the population – give a percentage by which the population of group 1 changes from year to year.\nNow suppose that the survival rates for group 1 and 2 are not known (so are no longer assumed to be 50% and 75%), but are assumed to be equal to one another. What value for this survival rate would make the population stable in the long run?\n\n\n5.3.20"
