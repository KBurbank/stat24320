Find all fixed points, if any, of the linear operators in the previous exercise.\n\nExercise 2.3.9\nWe require our matrix to be square (i.e., have the same number of rows and columns) to have a fixed point. For the matrices in the previous exercise, only the matrix in part (d) is square. The fixed points are the solutions to the system of equations\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nFirst, we subtract the right-hand side from the left-hand side to get\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThis simplifies to\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ x_{3}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nPutting our matrix into reduced row echelon form, we have\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}-2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\rightarrow\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThis is the identity matrix, which means that the system of equations is nonsingular and has a unique solution. Moreover, the right-hand side of the equation is the zero vector, which means that the fixed point is the zero vector: \\(\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\right)=\\left(0,0,0\\right)\\).\n\nfrom sympy import eye\n#| echo: false\n#| output: none\n\nA = Matrix([[-1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]])\n(A-eye(3))\n# append a zero vector to the right of the matrix\nR = (A-eye(3)).row_join(Matrix([0,0,0]))\nR.rref()\n\n(Matrix([\n [1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 1, 0]]),\n (0, 1, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n5 \nA linear operator on \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\) is defined by first applying a scaling operator with scale factors of 2 in the \\(x\\)-direction and 4 in the \\(y\\)-direction, followed by a counterclockwise rotation about the origin of \\(\\pi / 6\\) radians. Express this operator and the operator that results from reversing the order of the scaling and rotation as matrix operators.\n\nExercise 2.3.5 The scaling operator is given by the matrix\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nTo create a counterclockwise rotation by \\(\\theta\\) radians, we use the matrix\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nHere, we want to rotate by \\(\\pi / 6\\) radians, so we have\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{6} & -\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\\\\n\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} & \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{6}\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThe operator for the scaling followed by the rotation is the product of these two matrices:\n\\[T_{A}, A=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\sqrt{3} & -2 \\\\\n1 & 2 \\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThe operator for the rotation followed by the scaling is the product of the matrices in reverse order:\n\\[T_{B}, B=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\sqrt{3} & -1 \\\\\n2 & 2 \\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\n\n6 \nFind a scaling operator \\(S\\) and shearing operator \\(H\\) such that the concatenation \\(S \\circ H\\) maps the points \\((1,0)\\) to \\((2,0)\\) and \\((0,1)\\) to \\((4,3)\\).\n\nExercise 2.3.7\nWe know that the shearing operator must add a multiple of the \\(x_2\\) component to the \\(x_1\\) component. For now, we can write this as\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\alpha \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThen we can apply the shearing operator to our two points to get\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\alpha \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\alpha \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\alpha \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWe know our scaling operator will be of the form\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\ns & 0 \\\\\n0 & t\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nApplying this to our two points, we get\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\ns & 0 \\\\\n0 & t\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\ns \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\ns & 0 \\\\\n0 & t\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\n\\alpha \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\ns \\alpha \\\\\nt\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWe can now set up the equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ns &=2 , 0=0\\\\\n\\alpha s &=4,\nt =3\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is clear that the solutions to these equations are \\(s=2, t=3, \\alpha=2\\). Thus, our scaling operator is\n\\[\nS=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nand our shearing operator is\n\\[\nH=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nChecking:\n\nS = Matrix([[2, 0], [0, 3]])\nH = Matrix([[1, 2], [0, 1]])\nS*H*Matrix([1,0]), S*H*Matrix([0,1])\n\n(Matrix([\n [2],\n [0]]),\n Matrix([\n [4],\n [3]]))\n\n\n\n\n\n7 \nGiven transition matrices for discrete dynamical systems\n\n\\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}.1 & .3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & .4 & 1 \\\\ .9 & .3 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\) (b) \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\) (c) \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}.5 & .3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & .4 & 0 \\\\ .5 & .3 & 1\\end{array}\\right] \\quad\\) (d) \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}0 & 0 & 0.9 \\\\ 0.5 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.5 & 0.1\\end{array}\\right]\\) and initial state vector \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}=\\frac{1}{2}(1,1,0)\\), calculate the first and second state vector for each system and determine whether it is a Markov chain.\n\n\nExercise 2.3.11\nWe know going in that (d) is not a stochastic matrix, because the neither the first or second column sums to 1. The others are stochastic.\nFirst and second states are (a) \\((0.2,0.2,0.6)\\), \\((0.08,0.68,0.24)\\) (b) \\(\\frac{1}{2}(0,1,1), \\frac{1}{2}(1,1,0)\\) (c) \\((0.4,0.3,0.4),(0.26,0.08,0.66)\\) (d) \\((0,0.25,0.25),(0.225,0,0.15)\\)\nAs expected, the states sum to 1 for a-c, but not for d. Therefore a-c are Markov chains.\n\n\n\n8 \nFor each of the dynamical systems of the previous exercise, determine by calculation whether the system tends to a limiting steady-state vector. If so, what is it?\n\nExercise 2.3.12\nWe can do this in Python by multiplying the initial state vector by each matrix a large number of times and seeing if the result converges.\n\nfrom sympy import

Either way, please make sure to indicate who your partner was. (Please indicate very clearly what you are doing – which reports if any are joint, and with whom, etc, so I don’t get confused!)\n\nThis is the first time I’m assigning something like this, so please feel to reach out with questions or suggestions for improvement.\nProjects will be due on Friday night, 11:59pm.\n\nChapter 1 projects\nGas in a Tube\n(Shores 62)\nProblem Description: You are given a long tube of still dry air in which there are 7 sampling/insertion points equally spaced \\(1 / 6\\) meters apart from each other. The position of each point is measured by setting the leftmost point at 0.0 meters and rightmost at 1.0 meters. Initially, a small amount of a certain gas is inserted in the central insertion point. Subsequently, measurements of the concentration of the gas at each sampling/insertion point are taken at later times in seconds. The results of these measurements, which you may assume are accurate to about 2-3 digits, are specified in Table 1.1. Based on this information, your task is to determine the best estimate you can find for the true value of the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\) of this gas in a motionless air medium. Use this estimate and a marching method to calculate values of the material density function on the interval \\([0,1]\\) at times \\(t=210\\) and \\(t=300\\) and at the given spatial nodes.\nTable: Concentration data measurements of a gaseous material.\nProcedure: You should use equation (1.10) or some variant to move backward and forward in time. These will result in linear systems, which ALAMA calculator or another technology tool can solve. One way to proceed is simply to use trial and error until you think you’ve hit on a reasonable value of \\(D\\), that is, the one that gives the best approximation to \\(t=180\\) from the \\(t=360\\) values. Do not expect perfect matches - the data is relatively sparse. Then march backwards in time once more to get the initial values at \\(t=0\\). Finally, march forward in time to compute and plot the resulting approximate density function.\nOutput: Discus your results and provide a graph of profiles of the material density function at times in the data table along with your computed profiles.\nComments: This project introduces you to a very interesting area of mathematics called “inverse theory.” The idea is, rather than proceeding from problem (the governing equations for concentration values) to solution (concentration profiles), you are given the “solution,” namely the measured solution values at various points, and are to determine from this information the “problem,” i.e., the diffusion coefficient needed to define the governing equations.\nChapter 2 Projects\nLU Factorization\nWe didn’t yet get to the discussion of this in class. If you’re interested in doing this project, you can look at the second part of the Chapter 2 Lecture 4 slides.\n(Shores p. 177) Write a program module that implements Theorem 2.14 using partial pivoting and implicit row exchanges. This means that space is allocated for the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A=[a[i, j]]\\) and an array of row indices, say indx \\([i]\\). Initially, indx should consist of the integers \\(1,2, \\ldots, n\\). Whenever two rows need to be exchanged, say the first and third, then the indices indx[1] and indx[3] are exchanged. References to array elements throughout the Gaussian elimination process should be indirect: Refer to the \\((1,4)\\) th entry of \\(A\\) as the element \\(a[\\operatorname{indx}[1], 4]\\). This method of reference has the same effect as physically exchanging rows, but without the work. It also has the appealing feature that we can design the algorithm as though no row exchanges have taken place provided we replace the direct reference \\(a[i, j]\\) by the indirect reference \\(a[\\operatorname{indx}[i], j]\\). The module should return the lower/upper matrix in the format of Example 2.70 as well as the permuted array indx \\([i]\\). Effectively, this index array tells the user what the permutation matrix \\(P\\) is.\nUse this module to implement an LU system solver module that uses the \\(\\mathrm{LU}\\) factorization to solve a general linear system. Also write a module that finds the inverse of an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) by first using the LU factorization module, then making repeated use of the LU system solver to solve \\(A \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}=\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\) th column of the identity. Then we will have\n\\[\nA^{-1}=\\left[\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \\mathbf{x}^{(2)}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}^{(n)}\\right]\n\\]\nBe sure to document and test your code and report on the results.\nMarkov Chains\n(Shores p. 177)\nRefer to Example 2.19 and Section 2.3 for background. Three automobile insurance firms compete for a fixed market of customers. Annual premiums are sold to these customers. Label the companies A, B, and C. You work for Company A, and your team of market analysts has done a survey that draws the following conclusions: In each of the past three years, the number of A customers switching to B is \\(20 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) is \\(30 \\%\\). The number of \\(\\mathrm{B}\\) customers switching to \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) is \\(20 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) is \\(20 \\%\\). The number of \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) customers switching to \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) is \\(30 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{B}\\) is \\(10 \\%\\). Those who do not switch continue to use their current company’s insurance for the next year. Model this market as a Markov chain. Display the transition matrix for the model. Illustrate the workings of the model by showing what it would predict as the market shares three years from now if currently \\(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\), and \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) owned equal shares of the market.\nThe next part of your problem is as follows: Your team has tested two advertising campaigns in some smaller test markets and are confident that the first campaign will convince \\(20 \\%\\) of the B customers who would otherwise stay with B in a given year to switch to A. The second advertising campaign would convince \\(20 \\%\\) of the \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) customers who would otherwise stay with C in a given year to switch to A. Both campaigns have about equal costs and would not change other customers’ habits. Make a recommendation, based on your experiments with various possible initial state vectors for the market. Will these campaigns actually improve your company’s market share? If so, which one do you recommend? Write up your recommendation in the form of a report, with supporting evidence. It’s a good idea to hedge on your bets a little by pointing out limitations to your model and claims, so devote a few sentences to those points.\nIt would be a plus to carry the analysis further (your manager might appreciate that). For instance, you could turn the additional market share from, say B customers, into a variable and plot the long-term gain for your company against this variable. A manager could use this data to decide whether it was worthwhile to attempt gaining more customers from B.\nSports Ranking\n(Shores p. 180)\nRefer to Example 2.24 and Section 2.3 for background. As a sports analyst you are given the following data about a league of seven teams numbered 1-7, where the pair \\((j, k)\\) represents a game in which team \\(j\\) defeated team \\(k\\) :\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE= & \\{(1,2),(7,3),(2,4),(4,5),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1),(3,1),(7,2),(2,6), \\\\\n& (3,4),(7,4),(5,7),(6,4),(3,5),(5,6),(7,1),(5,2),(7,6),(1,4),(6,3)\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBased on these data you are to rank the teams. To this end, begin with the simplest method, ranking by win/loss record. Next, treat the data as defining a digraph. Begin this analysis by constructing the adjacency matrix of this digraph and drawing a picture of the digraph either by hand or using some software. Then rank the teams by using the following methods: First use the method of Example 2.26 to find a power ranking of each team. Then use the reverse PageRank idea of Example 2.47 to rank the the teams.\nNext, suppose you are given additional information, namely, the game margins (winning score minus losing score) for each game. Following is a list of these margins matching the order of matches in the definition of \\(E\\) :\n\\[\nM=\\{4,8,7,3,7,7,23,15,6,18,13,14,7,13,7,18,45,10,19,14,13\\}\n\\]\nIn order to utilize these data examine your picture of the digraph and label each edge with the margin that matches it in \\(M\\). You are now dealing with a weighted graph and one can construct a different sort of “adjacency matrix” by entering this margin in the \\((i, j)\\) th entry according as team \\(i\\) defeated team \\(j\\) by that margin.

Either way, please make sure to indicate who your partner was. (Please indicate very clearly what you are doing – which reports if any are joint, and with whom, etc, so I don’t get confused!)\n\nThis is the first time I’m assigning something like this, so please feel to reach out with questions or suggestions for improvement.\nProjects will be due on Friday night, 11:59pm.\n\nChapter 1 projects\nGas in a Tube\n(Shores 62)\nProblem Description: You are given a long tube of still dry air in which there are 7 sampling/insertion points equally spaced \\(1 / 6\\) meters apart from each other. The position of each point is measured by setting the leftmost point at 0.0 meters and rightmost at 1.0 meters. Initially, a small amount of a certain gas is inserted in the central insertion point. Subsequently, measurements of the concentration of the gas at each sampling/insertion point are taken at later times in seconds. The results of these measurements, which you may assume are accurate to about 2-3 digits, are specified in Table 1.1. Based on this information, your task is to determine the best estimate you can find for the true value of the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\) of this gas in a motionless air medium. Use this estimate and a marching method to calculate values of the material density function on the interval \\([0,1]\\) at times \\(t=210\\) and \\(t=300\\) and at the given spatial nodes.\nTable: Concentration data measurements of a gaseous material.\nProcedure: You should use equation (1.10) or some variant to move backward and forward in time. These will result in linear systems, which ALAMA calculator or another technology tool can solve. One way to proceed is simply to use trial and error until you think you’ve hit on a reasonable value of \\(D\\), that is, the one that gives the best approximation to \\(t=180\\) from the \\(t=360\\) values. Do not expect perfect matches - the data is relatively sparse. Then march backwards in time once more to get the initial values at \\(t=0\\). Finally, march forward in time to compute and plot the resulting approximate density function.\nOutput: Discus your results and provide a graph of profiles of the material density function at times in the data table along with your computed profiles.\nComments: This project introduces you to a very interesting area of mathematics called “inverse theory.” The idea is, rather than proceeding from problem (the governing equations for concentration values) to solution (concentration profiles), you are given the “solution,” namely the measured solution values at various points, and are to determine from this information the “problem,” i.e., the diffusion coefficient needed to define the governing equations.\nChapter 2 Projects\nLU Factorization\nWe didn’t yet get to the discussion of this in class. If you’re interested in doing this project, you can look at the second part of the Chapter 2 Lecture 4 slides.\n(Shores p. 177) Write a program module that implements Theorem 2.14 using partial pivoting and implicit row exchanges. This means that space is allocated for the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A=[a[i, j]]\\) and an array of row indices, say indx \\([i]\\). Initially, indx should consist of the integers \\(1,2, \\ldots, n\\). Whenever two rows need to be exchanged, say the first and third, then the indices indx[1] and indx[3] are exchanged. References to array elements throughout the Gaussian elimination process should be indirect: Refer to the \\((1,4)\\) th entry of \\(A\\) as the element \\(a[\\operatorname{indx}[1], 4]\\). This method of reference has the same effect as physically exchanging rows, but without the work. It also has the appealing feature that we can design the algorithm as though no row exchanges have taken place provided we replace the direct reference \\(a[i, j]\\) by the indirect reference \\(a[\\operatorname{indx}[i], j]\\). The module should return the lower/upper matrix in the format of Example 2.70 as well as the permuted array indx \\([i]\\). Effectively, this index array tells the user what the permutation matrix \\(P\\) is.\nUse this module to implement an LU system solver module that uses the \\(\\mathrm{LU}\\) factorization to solve a general linear system. Also write a module that finds the inverse of an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\) by first using the LU factorization module, then making repeated use of the LU system solver to solve \\(A \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}=\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\) th column of the identity. Then we will have\n\\[\nA^{-1}=\\left[\\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \\mathbf{x}^{(2)}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}^{(n)}\\right]\n\\]\nBe sure to document and test your code and report on the results.\nMarkov Chains\n(Shores p. 177)\nRefer to Example 2.19 and Section 2.3 for background. Three automobile insurance firms compete for a fixed market of customers. Annual premiums are sold to these customers. Label the companies A, B, and C. You work for Company A, and your team of market analysts has done a survey that draws the following conclusions: In each of the past three years, the number of A customers switching to B is \\(20 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) is \\(30 \\%\\). The number of \\(\\mathrm{B}\\) customers switching to \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) is \\(20 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) is \\(20 \\%\\). The number of \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) customers switching to \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) is \\(30 \\%\\), and to \\(\\mathrm{B}\\) is \\(10 \\%\\). Those who do not switch continue to use their current company’s insurance for the next year. Model this market as a Markov chain. Display the transition matrix for the model. Illustrate the workings of the model by showing what it would predict as the market shares three years from now if currently \\(\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{B}\\), and \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) owned equal shares of the market.\nThe next part of your problem is as follows: Your team has tested two advertising campaigns in some smaller test markets and are confident that the first campaign will convince \\(20 \\%\\) of the B customers who would otherwise stay with B in a given year to switch to A. The second advertising campaign would convince \\(20 \\%\\) of the \\(\\mathrm{C}\\) customers who would otherwise stay with C in a given year to switch to A. Both campaigns have about equal costs and would not change other customers’ habits. Make a recommendation, based on your experiments with various possible initial state vectors for the market. Will these campaigns actually improve your company’s market share? If so, which one do you recommend? Write up your recommendation in the form of a report, with supporting evidence. It’s a good idea to hedge on your bets a little by pointing out limitations to your model and claims, so devote a few sentences to those points.\nIt would be a plus to carry the analysis further (your manager might appreciate that). For instance, you could turn the additional market share from, say B customers, into a variable and plot the long-term gain for your company against this variable. A manager could use this data to decide whether it was worthwhile to attempt gaining more customers from B.\nSports Ranking\n(Shores p. 180)\nRefer to Example 2.24 and Section 2.3 for background. As a sports analyst you are given the following data about a league of seven teams numbered 1-7, where the pair \\((j, k)\\) represents a game in which team \\(j\\) defeated team \\(k\\) :\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE= & \\{(1,2),(7,3),(2,4),(4,5),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1),(3,1),(7,2),(2,6), \\\\\n& (3,4),(7,4),(5,7),(6,4),(3,5),(5,6),(7,1),(5,2),(7,6),(1,4),(6,3)\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBased on these data you are to rank the teams. To this end, begin with the simplest method, ranking by win/loss record. Next, treat the data as defining a digraph. Begin this analysis by constructing the adjacency matrix of this digraph and drawing a picture of the digraph either by hand or using some software. Then rank the teams by using the following methods: First use the method of Example 2.26 to find a power ranking of each team. Then use the reverse PageRank idea of Example 2.47 to rank the the teams.\nNext, suppose you are given additional information, namely, the game margins (winning score minus losing score) for each game. Following is a list of these margins matching the order of matches in the definition of \\(E\\) :\n\\[\nM=\\{4,8,7,3,7,7,23,15,6,18,13,14,7,13,7,18,45,10,19,14,13\\}\n\\]\nIn order to utilize these data examine your picture of the digraph and label each edge with the margin that matches it in \\(M\\). You are now dealing with a weighted graph and one can construct a different sort of “adjacency matrix” by entering this margin in the \\((i, j)\\) th entry according as team \\(i\\) defeated team \\(j\\) by that margin. Use this approach to calculate “power ranking”.\nIsoRank\nRead the discussion of IsoRank on pages 172-176.\nThe notion of embedding one graph into another is a useful idea for some scientific studies.

    "text": "Project Descriptions: These projects introduce more applications of digraphs as mathematical modeling tools. You are given that the digraph \\(G\\) has vertex set \\(V=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) and edge set\n\\[\nE=\\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,2),(1,4),(3,1),(3,6),(6,3),(4,5),(5,6)\\}\n\\]\nAddress the following points regarding \\(G\\).\n\n\nDraw a picture of this digraph. You may leave space in your report and draw this by hand, or if you prefer, you may use the computer drawing applications available to you on your system.\n\n\n\nExhibit the incidence matrix \\(A\\) of this digraph and find a basis for \\(\\mathcal{N}(A)\\) using its reduced row echelon form. Some of the basis elements may be algebraic but not directed loops. Use this basis to find a basis of directed loops (e.g., non-directed basis element \\(\\mathbf{c}_{1}\\) might be replaced by directed \\(\\mathbf{c}_{1}+\\mathbf{c}_{2}\\) ).\n\n\nThink of the digraph as representing an electrical circuit where an edge represents some electrical object like a resistor or capacitor. Each node represents the circuit space between these objects. and we can attach a potential value to each node, say the potentials are \\(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{6}\\). The potential difference across an edge is the potential value of head minus tail. Kirchhoff’s second law of electrical circuits says that the sum of potential differences around a circuit loop must be zero. Assume and use the fact (p. 422) that \\(A \\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) implies that for all \\(\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathcal{N}\\left(A^{T}\\right), \\mathbf{y}^{T} \\mathbf{b}=0\\) to find conditions that a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) must satisfy in order for it to be a vector of potential differences for some potential distribution on the vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume that across each edge of a circuit a current flows. Thus, we can assign to each edge a “weight,” namely the current flow along the edge. This is an example of a weighted digraph. However, not just any set of current weights will do, since Kirchhoff’s first law of circuits says that the total flow of current in and out of any node should be 0 . Use this law to find a matrix condition that must be satisfied by the currents and solve it to exhibit some current flows.\nThink of the digraph as representing a directed communications network. Here loops determine which nodes have bidirectional communication since any two nodes of a loop can only communicate with each other by way of a loop. By examining only a basis of directed loops how could you determine which nodes in the network can communicate with each other?\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of vertices of the digraph as representing airports and edges representing flight connections between airports for Gamma Airlines. Suppose further that for each connection there is a maximum number of daily flights that will be allowed by the destination airport from an origin airport and that, in the order that the edges in \\(E\\) are listed above, these limits are\n\n\\[\nM=\\{4,3,8,7,2,6,7,10,5,8\\} .\n\\]\nNow suppose that Gamma wants to maximize the flow of flights into airport 1 and out of airport 6 . Count inflows into an airport as positive and outflows as negative. Assume that the net in/outflow of Gamma flights at each airport 1 to 5 is zero, while the net inflow of such flights into airport 1 matches the net outflow from 6 .\n\nDescribe the problem of maximizing this inflow to airport 1 as a linear programming problem and express it in a standard form (block matrices are helpful.) Note that the appropriate variables are all outflows from one airport to another, i.e., along edges, together with the net inflow into airport 1.\nSolve the problem of part (a). Also solve the reverse problem: Maximize inflow into airport 6 and matching outflow from 1. Explain and justify your answers.\n\n\nWith the same limits on allowable flights into airports as in item 5, suppose that Gamma Airlines wants to determine an allocation of planes that will maximize their profits, given the following constraints: (1) Airports 1 and 6 have repair facilities for their planes, so no limit is placed on the inflow or outflow of their planes other than the airport limits. (2) Flights through airports 2-5 of Gamma planes are pass through, i.e., inflow and outflow must match. (3) Gamma has 32 planes available for this network of airports. (4) The profits per flight in thousands are, in the order that the edges in \\(E\\) are listed above,\n\n\\[\nP=\\{5,6,7,9,10,8,9,5,6,10\\}\n\\] (a) Set this problem up as a linear programming problem in standard form. Clearly identify the variables and explain how the constraints follow.\n\nSolve this problem explicitly and specify the operations taken to do so. Example 3.56 is instructive for this problem, so be aware of it. Use a technology tool that allows you to use elementary operations (ALAMA calculator has this capability)."

    "text": "Assume that across each edge of a circuit a current flows. Thus, we can assign to each edge a “weight,” namely the current flow along the edge. This is an example of a weighted digraph. However, not just any set of current weights will do, since Kirchhoff’s first law of circuits says that the total flow of current in and out of any node should be 0 . Use this law to find a matrix condition that must be satisfied by the currents and solve it to exhibit some current flows.\nThink of the digraph as representing a directed communications network.
