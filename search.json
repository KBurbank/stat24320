This entry is called the pivot. Perform row interchange (if necessary), so that the pivot is in the first row.\nUse a row operation to get a 1 as the entry in the first row and first column.\nUse row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column one.\nInterchange rows if necessary to obtain a nonzero number with the largest absolute value in the second row, second column. Use a row operation to make this entry 1. Use row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column two.\nRepeat step 4 for row 3, column 3. Continue moving along the main diagonal until you reach the last row, or until the number is zero.\n\n\nFull pivoting is where we also move the columns around to get the largest element to the front.\n” A square matrix 𝐴 has an 𝐿𝑈 factorization (without pivoting) if, and only if, no zero is encountered in the pivot position when computing an 𝐿𝑈 factorization of 𝐴. However, when does computations using floating point numbers a pivot that is nearly zero can lead to dramatic rounding errors. The simple workaround is to always permute the rows of the matrix such that the largest nonzero entry in a column is chosen as the pivot entry. This ensures that a nearly zero is never chosen. Complete pivoting goes even further by using row and column permutations to select the largest entry in the entire matrix as the pivot entry.” from here\nIt’s very rare to find yourself in a situation where you need complete pivoting, and sometimes it can be quite computationally expensive."

It’s a good idea to hedge on your bets a little by pointing out limitations to your model and claims, so devote a few sentences to those points.\nIt would be a plus to carry the analysis further (your manager might appreciate that).
